# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of Factory Pulse project operations to provide comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and bulk operations for efficient project management. The current system provides basic project operations, but requires significant improvements in batch processing, data validation, user experience, and operational efficiency to support large-scale project management workflows.

5. IF large datasets are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement pagination, virtualization, and progressive loading

### Requirement A3: Comprehensive Project Updates

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want comprehensive project update capabilities that handle complex data changes with validation and audit trails, so that I can maintain accurate project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating project fields THEN the system SHALL provide inline editing with immediate validation and auto-save functionality
2. WHEN making bulk field changes THEN the system SHALL support mass updates across multiple projects with confirmation dialogs
3. WHEN updating workflow stages THEN the system SHALL validate transitions and update related data automatically
4. WHEN modifying project relationships THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and update dependent records
5. IF update conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options and merge capabilities###
 Requirement A4: Safe Project Deletion

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want safe project deletion capabilities with proper safeguards and data preservation, so that I can manage project lifecycle while preventing accidental data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting projects THEN the system SHALL require confirmation with impact assessment and dependency warnings
2. WHEN performing soft deletes THEN the system SHALL archive projects with recovery options within a specified timeframe
3. WHEN handling project dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion of projects with active relationships or require cascade options
4. WHEN archiving project data THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails and preserve historical information
5. IF deletion is irreversible THEN the system SHALL require additional authorization and provide final warnings

## Group B: Bulk Operations

### Requirement B1: Bulk Project Management

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want efficient bulk project management capabilities, so that I can perform operations on multiple projects simultaneously to save time and ensure consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting multiple projects THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive selection tools with select all, filter-based selection, and range selection
2. WHEN performing bulk updates THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation of long-running operations
3. WHEN applying bulk changes THEN the system SHALL validate all changes before execution and show preview of affected records
4. WHEN bulk operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports and partial success handling
5. IF operations affect many records THEN the system SHALL implement background processing with status notifications

### Requirement B2: Bulk Data Import and Export

**User Story:** As a data administrator, I want robust bulk data import and export capabilities, so that I can efficiently migrate data, create backups, and integrate with external systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing project data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON) with field mapping and validation
2. WHEN exporting project data THEN the system SHALL provide customizable export templates with filtering and field selection
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement chunked processing with progress tracking and resume capabilities
4. WHEN handling import errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports with line-by-line validation results
5. IF data conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL offer merge strategies and duplicate handling options

### Requirement B3: Bulk Workflow Operations

**User Story:** As a workflow coordinator, I want bulk workflow operations to manage project stages and approvals efficiently, so that I can process multiple projects through workflow stages simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advancing multiple projects THEN the system SHALL validate workflow transitions for each project and show validation results
2. WHEN assigning reviewers in bulk THEN the system SHALL support role-based assignment and workload balancing
3. WHEN processing approvals THEN the system SHALL handle batch approvals with individual review capabilities
4. WHEN managing workflow exceptions THEN the system SHALL provide bulk bypass and rollback operations with proper authorization
5. IF workflow conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options and manual intervention capabilities

## Group C: Data Validation and Integrity

### Requirement C1: Comprehensive Data Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data validation for all project operations, so that I can maintain data quality and prevent system errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating project data THEN the system SHALL enforce business rules, data types, and constraint validation
2. WHEN checking data relationships THEN the system SHALL validate foreign key constraints and referential integrity
3. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize data and prevent injection attacks and malformed data
4. WHEN validating bulk operations THEN the system SHALL perform batch validation with detailed error reporting
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with correction suggestions

### Requirement C2: Audit Trail and Change Tracking

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails for all project operations, so that I can track changes, ensure accountability, and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
