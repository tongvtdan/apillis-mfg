# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the User Authentication & Role Management system, a foundational component of the Manufacturing RFQ Management Platform. This feature ensures secure access control and appropriate permissions for all user roles within the system, enabling different stakeholders to access only the functionality and data relevant to their responsibilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Secure User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in securely using multiple authentication methods so that I can access the system with confidence that my account is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL present both email/password and Google SSO authentication options
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them within 2 seconds under normal load
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message without revealing whether the email exists
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL generate a secure session token using Firebase Authentication
5. IF a user fails to authenticate 5 times consecutively THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes

### Requirement 2: Multi-Role User Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign and manage user roles so that each user has appropriate access permissions based on their responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created THEN the system SHALL support assignment to one of the following roles: Customer, Procurement Owner, Engineering, QA, Production, Supplier, Management
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their role-appropriate dashboard
3. WHEN an administrator views the user management interface THEN the system SHALL display all users with their current roles and status
4. WHEN an administrator changes a user's role THEN the system SHALL update the role immediately and log the change with timestamp and modifier identity
5. IF a user attempts to access functionality outside their role permissions THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect to an appropriate page

### Requirement 3: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the system to enforce role-based permissions at all levels so that users can only access data and functionality appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access any page THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions before rendering content
2. WHEN a user makes an API request THEN the system SHALL validate their role permissions before processing the request
3. WHEN a user interface loads THEN the system SHALL only display navigation items and actions available to their role
4. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return a 403 Forbidden response
5. WHEN role permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL complete the validation within 100ms

### Requirement 4: Session Management and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be managed securely so that my account remains protected while providing convenient access during my work session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session that persists across browser tabs and refreshes
2. WHEN a user is inactive for 24 hours THEN the system SHALL automatically expire their session and require re-authentication
3. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their session and redirect to the login page
4. WHEN a user logs out from one device THEN the system SHALL provide an option to log out from all devices
5. WHEN session data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all traffic using TLS 1.2 or higher

### Requirement 5: Password Security and Policy

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to enforce strong password policies so that user accounts are protected against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or updates their password THEN the system SHALL require at least 8 characters including uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
2. WHEN a user's password is 90 days old THEN the system SHALL prompt them to update their password on next login
3. WHEN a user enters an incorrect password THEN the system SHALL not reveal whether the email address exists in the system
4. WHEN a user requests password reset THEN the system SHALL send a secure reset link valid for 1 hour
5. IF a user account is locked due to failed attempts THEN the system SHALL require email verification to unlock

### Requirement 6: Audit Logging and Compliance

**User Story:** As an auditor, I want comprehensive logging of authentication events and role changes so that I can track system access and maintain compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp, IP address, user agent, and success/failure status
2. WHEN a user's role is modified THEN the system SHALL log the change with the modifier's identity, timestamp, old role, and new role
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure they are immutable and tamper-evident
4. WHEN audit data is requested THEN the system SHALL retain logs for at least 1 year for compliance purposes
5. IF suspicious login patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag the account for security review

### Requirement 7: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information so that my account details remain current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current information including name, email, role, and last login
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the system SHALL validate the changes and save them immediately
3. WHEN a user changes their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification before updating
4. IF a user is inactive for 6 months THEN the system SHALL mark their account as dormant and notify administrators
5. WHEN a user's status changes THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes
