# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical need to audit and align the Factory Pulse project management system with the current database schema. Based on the MEMORY.md documentation, we have a fully operational local Supabase database with 17 sample projects, but the frontend code may have inconsistencies with the actual database structure. This audit will ensure data integrity, proper functionality, and seamless user experience across all project-related features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Alignment Audit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all project-related frontend code matches the current database schema, so that the application functions correctly without data mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the projects table schema THEN the system SHALL identify all column names, data types, and constraints
2. WHEN comparing frontend TypeScript interfaces THEN the system SHALL identify any mismatches with database columns
3. WHEN reviewing project service methods THEN the system SHALL verify all database queries use correct column names
4. WHEN analyzing project hooks THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data mapping and transformation
5. IF mismatches are found THEN the system SHALL document all discrepancies with specific file locations and line numbers

### Requirement 2: Project Pages Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want all project pages to display accurate data from the database, so that I can effectively manage projects without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Projects list page THEN the system SHALL display all sample projects correctly
2. WHEN viewing project details THEN the system SHALL show accurate information matching database records
3. WHEN filtering or sorting projects THEN the system SHALL use correct database field names
4. WHEN updating project status THEN the system SHALL use valid status values from the database constraints
5. IF any page fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3: Project Workflow Management Audit

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want the project workflow system to accurately reflect the database workflow stages, so that project progression is properly tracked and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining workflow stages THEN the system SHALL verify alignment with workflow_stages table
2. WHEN transitioning project stages THEN the system SHALL use correct stage IDs and validation rules
3. WHEN displaying stage information THEN the system SHALL show accurate stage names, colors, and order
4. WHEN calculating stage metrics THEN the system SHALL use proper database relationships
5. IF workflow inconsistencies exist THEN the system SHALL document required corrections

### Requirement 4: Data Type and Field Mapping Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data types and field mappings to be consistent between frontend and backend, so that data operations are reliable and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing project data THEN the system SHALL handle all database field types correctly
2. WHEN displaying dates THEN the system SHALL format timestamp fields appropriately
3. WHEN handling nullable fields THEN the system SHALL provide proper default values and null checks
4. WHEN working with foreign keys THEN the system SHALL maintain proper relationships (customer_id, assigned_to, etc.)
5. IF type mismatches exist THEN the system SHALL provide specific correction recommendations

### Requirement 5: Project Component Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all project components to work seamlessly with the current database, so that the entire project management system functions as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing ProjectTable component THEN the system SHALL display all project fields correctly
2. WHEN testing ProjectDetail components THEN the system SHALL load and display complete project information
3. WHEN testing project forms THEN the system SHALL validate and submit data using correct field names
4. WHEN testing project workflow components THEN the system SHALL interact properly with workflow_stages table
5. IF component failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error analysis and fix recommendations

### Requirement 6: Performance and Optimization Audit

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the project management system to perform efficiently with the current database structure, so that users experience fast and responsive interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading project lists THEN the system SHALL use optimized queries with proper indexing
2. WHEN fetching project details THEN the system SHALL minimize database calls through efficient joins
3. WHEN updating project data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate caching strategies
4. WHEN handling real-time updates THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
5. IF performance issues exist THEN the system SHALL recommend specific optimizations

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle database errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connections fail THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
2. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific field-level errors
3. WHEN projects cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL offer retry mechanisms
4. WHEN real-time updates fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to manual refresh options
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Maintenance Guidelines

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the project management system architecture, so that future maintenance and updates can be performed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting database schema THEN the system SHALL provide complete field descriptions and relationships
2. WHEN documenting component architecture THEN the system SHALL show data flow and dependencies
3. WHEN documenting API endpoints THEN the system SHALL include request/response formats
4. WHEN documenting workflow logic THEN the system SHALL explain stage transitions and validation rules
5. IF documentation gaps exist THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive guides for all identified areas
