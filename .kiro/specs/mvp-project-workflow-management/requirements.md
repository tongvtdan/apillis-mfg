# Requirements Document - MVP Project Workflow Management

## Introduction

This specification defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Factory Pulse project workflow management. The focus is on core project management capabilities: stage transitions with flow control, approval management, document handling, and basic project communication. Analytics and advanced features are deferred to future phases.

## Core Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Stage Management

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to manage project stages with clear progression rules, so that projects follow the correct workflow and nothing gets missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a project THEN the system SHALL display the current stage and available next stages
2. WHEN advancing a project stage THEN the system SHALL validate stage transition rules before allowing progression
3. WHEN a stage requires approvals THEN the system SHALL prevent advancement until all required approvals are obtained
4. WHEN a stage has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL check completion of required tasks/documents before allowing advancement
5. IF stage advancement fails validation THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining what needs to be completed

### Requirement 2: Approval Workflow Management

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want to approve or reject project stage transitions, so that quality gates are maintained throughout the project lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project needs approval THEN the system SHALL notify assigned approvers via email and in-app notifications
2. WHEN reviewing for approval THEN the system SHALL display project details, documents, and approval criteria
3. WHEN approving/rejecting THEN the system SHALL require comments and update the project status immediately
4. WHEN all required approvals are obtained THEN the system SHALL automatically enable stage advancement
5. IF approval is rejected THEN the system SHALL notify the project team and prevent stage advancement until issues are resolved

### Requirement 3: Document Management

**User Story:** As a project team member, I want to upload, organize, and manage project documents, so that all project information is centralized and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL support common file types (PDF, DOC, XLS, images) with drag-and-drop functionality
2. WHEN organizing documents THEN the system SHALL allow categorization by document type and project stage
3. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL provide file preview for supported formats and download options
4. WHEN documents are required for stage advancement THEN the system SHALL validate document presence before allowing progression
5. IF documents are missing THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which documents are required for each stage

### Requirement 4: Project Communication

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to communicate about project issues and updates, so that everyone stays informed and aligned.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding project comments THEN the system SHALL support threaded discussions with @mentions for team members
2. WHEN important updates occur THEN the system SHALL send notifications to relevant stakeholders
3. WHEN viewing project history THEN the system SHALL display a timeline of comments, stage changes, and document uploads
4. WHEN communicating externally THEN the system SHALL support email integration for customer/supplier communication
5. IF urgent issues arise THEN the system SHALL support priority flagging and escalation notifications

### Requirement 5: Basic Project Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, view, update, and manage projects efficiently, so that I can handle my daily project management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating projects THEN the system SHALL provide a simple form with essential fields and automatic ID generation
2. WHEN viewing projects THEN the system SHALL display project lists with filtering by stage, priority, and assigned user
3. WHEN updating projects THEN the system SHALL support inline editing of basic project information
4. WHEN searching projects THEN the system SHALL provide text search across project names, descriptions, and IDs
5. IF project data is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages and prevent data corruption

## Technical Requirements

### Requirement 6: User Authentication & Roles

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control, so that users only see and can modify appropriate project information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate via Supabase Auth with role assignment
2. WHEN accessing features THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Team Member, Viewer)
3. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL log user activities for audit purposes
4. WHEN roles change THEN the system SHALL update user permissions immediately
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 7: Data Integrity & Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to be reliable and fast, so that I can work efficiently without delays or data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading project data THEN the system SHALL display results within 2 seconds for normal operations
2. WHEN saving changes THEN the system SHALL provide optimistic updates with rollback on errors
3. WHEN multiple users edit THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent updates with conflict resolution
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling and recovery options
5. IF data becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL provide data validation and correction mechanisms
