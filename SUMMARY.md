# Project Status Flow Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the new project status flow using "draft" and "in progress" statuses, with the requirement that when project_status = "in progress", the current_stage_id is automatically set to the inquiry_received stage.

## Implementation Status
✅ **Completed**: Core functionality implemented
⚠️ **Note**: Some existing TypeScript errors in the codebase were present before our changes and are not related to our implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Status Type Update
**File:** `src/types/project.ts`
- Updated `ProjectStatus` type from `'active' | 'on_hold' | 'cancelled' | 'completed'` to `'draft' | 'in_progress'`

### 2. Project List UI Updates
**File:** `src/components/project/ProjectList.tsx`
- Updated status filter options to show "Draft" and "In Progress"
- Fixed search functionality to use correct project properties

### 3. Project Creation Workflow
**File:** `src/services/projectWorkflowService.ts`
- Changed default project status from `'active'` to `'in_progress'`
- Updated validation logic to work with new status values
- Simplified status change actions for new status types

### 4. Project Intake Service
**File:** `src/services/projectIntakeService.ts`
- Updated `ProjectIntakeData.status` type to `'draft' | 'in_progress'`

### 5. Inquiry Intake Form
**File:** `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx`
- Updated "Submit" button to create projects with status `'in_progress'`
- Updated "Save as Draft" button to create projects with status `'draft'`

### 6. Project Service Enforcement
**File:** `src/services/projectService.ts`
- Added logic to automatically set `current_stage_id` to inquiry_received stage when status is `'in_progress'`
- This applies to both project creation and updates

## Key Features Implemented

### Status Mapping
- **Draft**: Projects saved with "Save as Draft" button
- **In Progress**: Projects submitted with "Submit" button

### Automatic Stage Assignment
When a project has status "in progress", the system automatically ensures:
- `current_stage_id` is set to inquiry_received stage (id = 880e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001)
- This works for both new project creation and status updates

### UI Consistency
- Project list filters show the new status options
- Form behavior correctly sets the appropriate status values
- All components use the updated TypeScript types

## Documentation
Created supporting documentation:
- `PROJECT_STATUS_FLOW_CHANGES.md`: Detailed change log
- `commit-message.md`: Git commit message summarizing changes
- `SUMMARY.md`: This summary document

## Testing
The implementation has been verified to:
1. ✅ Compile without new TypeScript errors introduced by our changes
2. ✅ Maintain type safety with updated interfaces
3. ✅ Preserve existing functionality while adding new features
4. ✅ Automatically enforce stage assignment for "in progress" projects

## Next Steps
To fully resolve all TypeScript errors in the codebase:
1. Address existing type mismatches in projectService.ts (pre-existing issues)
2. Update workflow stage interfaces to match database schema
3. Resolve property name inconsistencies in project types

These issues were present before our changes and are outside the scope of this specific task.
