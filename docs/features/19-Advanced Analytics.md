# Requirements Document: Feature 19 - Advanced Analytics



## Introduction
The Advanced Analytics module uses machine learning and data science to provide deep, forward-looking insights that drive strategic decision-making and continuous improvement. It enables predictive modeling, cost forecasting, and performance benchmarking to help the organization optimize margins, plan capacity, and stay competitive.

## Stakeholders
- Management
- CFO
- Procurement Director
- Operations Manager
- Data Scientist

## Requirements

### Requirement 19.1: Machine Learning for Quote Optimization and Margin Prediction
**User Story:** As a CFO, I want the system to recommend optimal pricing, so I can maximize profitability while maintaining competitiveness.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL use historical win/loss data, customer behavior, and market conditions to train a machine learning model.
- WHEN a quote is being prepared, the system SHALL simulate multiple pricing scenarios and recommend an optimal price point.
- The recommendation SHALL include predicted win probability and expected margin.

### Requirement 19.2: Predictive Maintenance Scheduling
**User Story:** As an Operations Manager, I want to predict when machines need maintenance, so I can avoid unplanned downtime.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL integrate with machine IoT data (e.g., vibration, temperature, runtime).
- It SHALL use predictive models to forecast maintenance needs based on usage patterns.
- Alerts SHALL be generated for scheduled maintenance and sent to the production team.

### Requirement 19.3: Demand Forecasting
**User Story:** As a Procurement Director, I want to forecast future order volumes, so I can plan raw material purchases and capacity.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL analyze historical RFQ and order data to predict future demand.
- Forecasts SHALL be generated at multiple levels: product line, customer segment, and overall business.
- Users SHALL be able to adjust forecasts based on market intelligence.

### Requirement 19.4: Cost Trend Analysis
**User Story:** As a Finance Manager, I want to track long-term cost trends, so I can identify savings opportunities.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL analyze material, labor, and overhead costs over time.
- It SHALL visualize trends and identify significant changes (e.g., material price spikes).
- Alerts SHALL be triggered if costs exceed historical benchmarks.

### Requirement 19.5: Performance Benchmarking Against Industry Standards
**User Story:** As a CEO, I want to compare our performance against industry benchmarks, so I can identify areas for improvement.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow import or integration of industry benchmark data (e.g., average quote turnaround time, win rate).
- It SHALL generate comparative reports showing internal KPIs vs. industry averages.
- Benchmarks SHALL be anonymized and aggregated to protect privacy.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Model training SHALL be performed during off-peak hours.
- Predictive accuracy SHALL be evaluated monthly and reported.
- All analytics features SHALL be optional and can be disabled by administrators.

# Design Document: Feature 19 - Advanced Analytics

## Overview
This module provides enterprise-level business intelligence by applying machine learning and statistical modeling to historical and real-time data. It transforms the platform from an operational tool into a strategic decision-support system.

## Components and Interfaces

### Backend Services

#### 1. Quote Optimization Engine (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** RFQ data, historical quotes, win/loss outcomes, customer tier.
- **Process:** Uses a classification/regression model to predict win probability and optimal price.
- **Output:** Recommended price, margin, and win probability.

#### 2. Predictive Maintenance Service (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Machine IoT data (via API or CSV import).
- **Process:** Applies time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict failure.
- **Output:** Maintenance alert with predicted failure date and confidence.

#### 3. Demand Forecasting Engine (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Historical RFQ and order data, seasonality, market trends.
- **Process:** Uses exponential smoothing or Prophet model for forecasting.
- **Output:** Monthly/quarterly demand predictions with confidence intervals.

#### 4. Cost Trend Analyzer (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Historical cost data (material, labor, overhead).
- **Process:** Applies trend analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Output:** Visual charts and alerts for significant cost changes.

#### 5. Benchmarking Engine (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Internal KPIs, imported industry benchmarks.
- **Process:** Normalizes and compares data.
- **Output:** Side-by-side reports with variance analysis.

## Data Model

### Analytics Models Collection
```json
analyticsModels (collection)
  â””â”€â”€ {modelId}
      â”œâ”€â”€ type: "quote_optimization" | "demand_forecast" | "cost_trend"
      â”œâ”€â”€ version: number
      â”œâ”€â”€ trainingDataPeriod: { start: timestamp, end: timestamp }
      â”œâ”€â”€ accuracy: number
      â”œâ”€â”€ lastTrainedAt: timestamp
      â”œâ”€â”€ status: "active" | "training" | "failed"
      â””â”€â”€ config: { ... }
```

### Forecast Results
```json
forecasts (collection)
  â””â”€â”€ {forecastId}
      â”œâ”€â”€ type: "demand" | "maintenance"
      â”œâ”€â”€ entityId: string // e.g., machineId, productLineId
      â”œâ”€â”€ predictions: [
        { date: timestamp, value: number, confidenceLow: number, confidenceHigh: number }
      ]
      â”œâ”€â”€ generatedAt: timestamp
      â””â”€â”€ notes: string
```

## Security Considerations
- Advanced analytics features are restricted to Management and Executive roles.
- Benchmark data is anonymized and secured.
- All model training data is encrypted at rest.

## Performance Optimization
- Model training is scheduled during off-peak hours.
- Predictions are cached for 24 hours.
- Frontend uses lazy loading for complex visualizations.

## Testing Strategy
- Validate model accuracy with holdout datasets.
- Test forecasting logic with historical backtesting.
- Simulate model failure and verify graceful degradation.
