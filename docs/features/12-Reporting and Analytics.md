# Requirements Document: Feature 12 - Reporting & Analytics



## Introduction
The Reporting & Analytics module provides management with data-driven insights into the performance of the RFQ process, supplier performance, and overall business health. It enables strategic decision-making through visual dashboards, trend analysis, and exportable reports.

## Stakeholders
- Management
- Procurement Owner
- Sales Manager
- Finance Team
- System Administrator

## Requirements

### Requirement 12.1: Win/Loss Ratio and Conversion Rate Analysis
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to view win/loss ratios and conversion rates, so I can assess sales effectiveness and market competitiveness.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL display the overall win/loss ratio and conversion rate.
- Data SHALL be filterable by time range (e.g., last 30, 90, 365 days).
- Charts SHALL show trends over time (e.g., weekly, monthly).

### Requirement 12.2: Lead Time Analytics per Phase
**User Story:** As a Process Owner, I want to analyze lead times for each phase of the RFQ lifecycle, so I can identify inefficiencies.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL calculate and display average lead times for each workflow phase.
- Data SHALL be broken down by product type, customer, or RFQ complexity.
- The view SHALL support comparison against historical data.

### Requirement 12.3: Supplier Performance Reporting
**User Story:** As a Procurement Manager, I want to track supplier performance, so I can make informed sourcing decisions.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL generate reports on:
  - On-time delivery rate
  - Quality defect rate
  - Quote response time
  - Cost competitiveness
- Reports SHALL be available per supplier and across all suppliers.
- Data SHALL be visualized in charts and sortable tables.

### Requirement 12.4: Process Bottleneck Identification
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to identify process bottlenecks, so I can improve throughput and reduce turnaround time.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL automatically detect phases with the longest average processing time.
- Bottlenecks SHALL be highlighted in the workflow metrics dashboard.
- The system SHALL allow filtering by time period and department.

### Requirement 12.5: Management Dashboards with KPIs
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want a consolidated view of key performance indicators, so I can monitor business health at a glance.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL provide a customizable dashboard with KPIs such as:
  - Quote turnaround time
  - Win rate
  - Average margin
  - RFQ volume
- KPIs SHALL be displayed with trend indicators (up/down/stable).
- The dashboard SHALL support drill-down into detailed reports.

### Requirement 12.6: Exportable Reports
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to export reports, so I can share them in presentations and meetings.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow exporting any report to Excel (.xlsx) and PDF formats.
- Exports SHALL include charts, tables, and metadata (date, user, filters).
- Users SHALL be able to schedule recurring report deliveries via email.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Report generation SHALL complete within 5 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 RFQs.
- Access to reporting features SHALL be restricted to Management, Admin, and Procurement roles.
- All data exports SHALL comply with GDPR and CCPA.

# Design Document: Feature 12 - Reporting & Analytics

## Overview
This module aggregates data from across the platform to generate meaningful reports and visualizations for management and operational review. It supports strategic decision-making with real-time KPIs, trend analysis, and deep-dive reporting.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Management Dashboard
```typescript
interface ManagementDashboardProps {
  timeRange: '7d' | '30d' | '90d' | 'custom';
  kpis: KPI[];
  onTimeRangeChange: (range: TimeRange) => void;
}

interface KPI {
  id: 'win_rate' | 'conversion_rate' | 'avg_lead_time' | 'on_time_delivery';
  title: string;
  currentValue: number;
  targetValue?: number;
  trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
  trendValue: number;
}
```

#### 2. Report Generation Interface
- Allows selection of report type, date range, filters, and export format.
- Supports scheduling and email delivery.

#### 3. Data Visualization Components
- Charts and graphs for:
  - Win/Loss ratio over time
  - Lead time distribution per phase
  - Supplier performance comparison
  - Bottleneck identification (e.g., phase with longest average time)

### Backend Services

#### 1. Report Generation Service (Cloud Function)
- Aggregates data from Firestore collections (`rfqs`, `quotes`, `suppliers`, `reviews`).
- Performs calculations for KPIs and metrics.
- Formats data for the frontend or for export.

#### 2. Export Service (Cloud Function)
- Generates Excel (XLSX) and PDF reports from aggregated data.
- Uses SheetJS and Puppeteer for rendering.

## Database Schema
- This feature primarily reads from existing collections and does not require a new schema.
- Aggregation is performed server-side for performance.

## Data Models

### Report Type Model
```typescript
enum ReportType {
  WIN_LOSS_ANALYSIS = 'win_loss_analysis',
  LEAD_TIME_ANALYTICS = 'lead_time_analytics',
  SUPPLIER_PERFORMANCE = 'supplier_performance',
  PROCESS_BOTTLENECKS = 'process_bottlenecks',
  KPI_DASHBOARD = 'kpi_dashboard'
}
```

### Filter Options
```typescript
interface ReportFilters {
  dateRange: { start: Date; end: Date };
  customers?: string[];
  products?: string[];
  suppliers?: string[];
  complexity?: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High';
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Reporting and analytics features are restricted to Management, Admin, and Procurement roles.
- All data access is enforced via Firestore Security Rules and route guards.

### Data Protection
- Reports containing sensitive data are protected by RBAC.
- Exported files are generated with secure signed URLs.

## Performance Optimization
- Aggregated data is cached for common time ranges (e.g., last 30 days).
- Firestore composite indexes optimize query performance.
- Large reports are generated asynchronously.
