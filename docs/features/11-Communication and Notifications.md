# Requirements Document: Feature 11 - Communication & Notifications



## Introduction
The Communication & Notifications system ensures that all stakeholders are kept informed of critical events and deadlines within the RFQ lifecycle, reducing the risk of delays and improving accountability. It provides multi-channel alerts, internal messaging, and a complete log of customer and supplier interactions.

## Stakeholders
- Procurement Owner
- Engineering Team
- QA Team
- Production Team
- Sales/Account Manager
- Supplier
- Management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL send automated emails for:
  - RFQ assignment
  - Status changes
  - Review requests
  - Approval requests
  - Deadline approaching (24h and 2h before)
  - RFQ becoming overdue
- Emails SHALL include relevant context: RFQ ID, project name, deadline, and link to the RFQ.
- Templates SHALL be customizable by administrators.

### Requirement 11.2: SMS Alerts for Critical Deadlines
**User Story:** As a Team Member, I want to receive SMS alerts for critical deadlines, so I donâ€™t miss urgent tasks.

- Messages SHALL support text, file attachments, and @mentions.
- All messages SHALL be logged and searchable.

### Requirement 11.4: Customer Communication Tracking
**User Story:** As a Sales Manager, I want to track all interactions with a customer, so I have a complete audit trail.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL log all customer communications (emails, calls) in the RFQâ€™s communication log.
- Logs SHALL include: timestamp, participants, subject, summary, and outcome.
- The system SHALL integrate with the companyâ€™s email server to auto-import sent emails.

### Requirement 11.5: Push Notifications
**User Story:** As a User, I want to receive push notifications on my mobile and web browser, so I can respond quickly to urgent events.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL send push notifications for:
  - New assignments
  - Approaching deadlines
  - Overdue tasks
  - Approval requests
- Notifications SHALL be delivered to web browsers and mobile devices.
- Users SHALL be able to manage notification preferences.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### `design-feature11.md`

# Design Document: Feature 11 - Communication & Notifications

## Overview
This system automates the flow of information within the platform, ensuring that users are proactively notified of events and that all communication is logged for traceability. It supports multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, push) and provides tools for internal and external collaboration.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Notification Center
```typescript
interface NotificationCenterProps {
  userId: string;
  notifications: Notification[];
  onMarkAsRead: (notificationId: string) => void;
  onMarkAllAsRead: () => void;
}

interface Notification {
  id: string;
  type: 'assignment' | 'deadline_reminder' | 'overdue' | 'status_change' | 'approval';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  rfqId: string;
  rfqName: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  read: boolean;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  actions: NotificationAction[];
}
```

#### 2. Internal Messaging System
```typescript
interface MessagingThreadProps {
  threadId: string;
  participants: User[];
  messages: Message[];
  onSendMessage: (content: string) => void;
}

interface Message {
  messageId: string;
  senderId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  attachments?: Document[];
  mentions?: string[]; // userIds
}
```

#### 3. Communication Log
- A timeline view within the RFQ detail page that aggregates:
  - Notifications
  - Internal messages
  - Logged emails and calls

### Backend Services

#### 1. Notification Service (Cloud Function)
```typescript
interface NotificationRequest {
  recipients: NotificationTarget[];
  type: NotificationType;
  rfqId: string;
  priority: NotificationPriority;
  scheduledFor?: Timestamp; // For reminders
}

interface NotificationTarget {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  preferredChannels: ('email' | 'sms' | 'push')[];
}
```
- Triggers based on:
  - RFQ assignment
  - Status changes
  - Deadline approaching (scheduled)
  - RFQ becoming overdue

#### 2. Email & SMS Gateway
- Integrates with SendGrid for email and Twilio (or similar) for SMS.
- Handles delivery status and retries.

## Database Schema

### Notifications Collection
```typescript
interface Notification {
  notificationId: string;
  recipientId: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  rfqId: string;
  priority: string;
  sentAt: Timestamp;
  deliveredAt?: Timestamp;
  readAt?: Timestamp;
  deliveryStatus: 'pending' | 'delivered' | 'failed';
  retryCount: number;
}
```

### Messages Sub-collection
```typescript
// Within rfqs/{rfqId}/messages
interface Message {
  messageId: string;
  senderId: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  attachments: DocumentRef[];
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Users can only see notifications and messages relevant to RFQs they have access to.
- Message history is immutable.

### Data Protection
- All communication data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Ensure the notification service can handle a high volume of events.
- Test the retry mechanism for failed deliveries.
