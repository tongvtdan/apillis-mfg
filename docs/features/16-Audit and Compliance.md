# Requirements Document: Feature 16 - Audit & Compliance



## Introduction
The Audit & Compliance module ensures that the RFQ Management Platform meets the highest standards for data integrity, traceability, and regulatory adherence. It provides a comprehensive, immutable audit trail to support compliance with manufacturing quality standards such as ISO 9001, AS9100, and IATF 16949, as well as data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

## Stakeholders
- Auditor
- System Administrator
- Quality Manager
- Management
- Legal/Compliance Officer

## Requirements

### Requirement 16.1: Comprehensive Audit Trail
**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want a complete record of all user actions, so I can verify system integrity and compliance.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL log every create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operation on key entities (RFQs, documents, users, quotes).
- Each log entry SHALL include:
  - Action type (e.g., `rfq_created`, `status_updated`, `document_uploaded`)
  - User ID and name
  - Timestamp (UTC)
  - Entity ID and type
  - Previous and new values (for updates/deletes)
  - IP address and user agent (optional)
- Logs SHALL be append-only and immutable.

### Requirement 16.2: Support for ISO 9001, AS9100, IATF 16949
**User Story:** As a Quality Manager, I want the system to support our quality management standards, so we can pass audits successfully.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL provide audit reports that map to the requirements of ISO 9001, AS9100, and IATF 16949.
- Key processes (e.g., document control, review approvals, change management) SHALL be fully traceable.
- The system SHALL support version control and approval workflows for critical documents.

### Requirement 16.3: GDPR/CCPA Compliance
**User Story:** As a Legal Officer, I want the system to comply with data privacy laws, so we avoid regulatory penalties.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL identify and tag personal data (e.g., user names, emails, customer contacts).
- Users SHALL have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of their data.
- Data deletion SHALL be handled in accordance with retention policies and audit requirements.

### Requirement 16.4: Data Retention Policies
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to enforce data retention rules, so we manage storage and compliance effectively.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow administrators to define retention periods for different data types (e.g., 7 years for RFQs, 3 years for logs).
- WHEN data reaches its retention period, the system SHALL automatically archive or delete it.
- Retention policies SHALL be logged and auditable.

### Requirement 16.5: Immutable Change Logs
**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want to ensure that audit logs cannot be tampered with, so the record is trustworthy.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `audit_log` collection SHALL be write-only; no updates or deletions allowed.
- Firestore Security Rules SHALL enforce immutability.
- Logs SHALL be backed up regularly and stored in a separate, secure location.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Audit logging SHALL have minimal impact on system performance (<5% overhead).
- Audit logs SHALL be searchable and filterable by user, action, entity, and date range.
- The system SHALL support exporting audit logs for external review.

# Design Document: Feature 16 - Audit & Compliance

## Overview
This module provides a robust, tamper-proof system for tracking every change in the platform, ensuring full traceability and meeting stringent quality and data privacy standards. It supports compliance with ISO 9001, AS9100, IATF 16949, GDPR, and CCPA through automated logging, retention policies, and reporting.

## Components and Interfaces

### Backend Services

#### 1. Audit Logging Service (Cloud Function)
- A middleware or trigger that fires on every database write operation (create, update, delete).
- Captures:
  - `action` (e.g., 'rfq_created', 'status_updated', 'document_uploaded')
  - `userId`
  - `timestamp`
  - `entityId` (e.g., RFQ ID, Document ID)
  - `entityType` ('rfq', 'document', 'user', 'quote')
  - `oldValue` (for updates/deletes)
  - `newValue` (for creates/updates)
  - `metadata` (IP, user agent)
- Stores the log entry in an immutable `audit_log` collection.

#### 2. Data Retention Manager (Scheduled Cloud Function)
- Runs daily to identify expired data.
- Applies retention policies (archive or delete).
- Logs all actions in the audit trail.

## Database Schema

### Audit Log Collection
```typescript
interface AuditLogEntry {
  logId: string;
  action: string; // e.g., 'rfq.status.update'
  userId: string;
  userName: string; // Snapshot for immutability
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  entityId: string; // e.g., RFQ ID, Document ID
  entityType: 'rfq' | 'document' | 'user' | 'quote';
  oldValue?: Record<string, any>; // JSON snapshot of the data before the change
  newValue?: Record<string, any>; // JSON snapshot of the data after the change
  metadata?: Record<string, any>; // e.g., IP address, user agent
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- The audit log is read-only for Auditors and Admins.
- All access to the audit log is itself logged.
- The `audit_log` collection has strict security rules preventing any modification or deletion.

### Data Protection
- The audit log is designed to be immutable (append-only).
- Regular backups are performed and stored in a separate project or region.

## Compliance Mapping
- The system generates compliance reports that map log entries to ISO 9001 clauses (e.g., 7.5 Document Control, 8.2 Review).
- GDPR reports include data subject access requests and deletion logs.

## Testing Strategy
- Validate that every CRUD operation generates a log entry.
- Test immutability by attempting to delete or modify a log entry (should fail).
- Verify retention policy enforcement in staging.
