# Requirements Document: Feature 17 - Security & Performance


## Introduction
The Security & Performance module ensures that the RFQ Management Platform is resilient, fast, and protected against threats, providing a reliable and secure experience for all users. It encompasses encryption, authentication, system reliability, and performance optimization to meet enterprise-grade standards.

## Stakeholders
- System Administrator
- IT Security Officer
- DevOps Engineer
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 17.1: SSL/TLS Encryption for All Data in Transit
**User Story:** As an IT Security Officer, I want all data to be encrypted in transit, so it cannot be intercepted or tampered with.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL use HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ for all client-server communication.
- All API endpoints and static assets SHALL be served over encrypted connections.
- Mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages) SHALL be prevented.

### Requirement 17.2: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to enforce MFA for sensitive roles, so we can prevent unauthorized access.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL support MFA (e.g., SMS, authenticator app) for user login.
- MFA SHALL be mandatory for Admin, Management, and Procurement Owner roles.
- Users SHALL be able to enroll and manage MFA methods in their profile.

### Requirement 17.3: Regular Data Backup and Recovery Procedures
**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer, I want regular backups and tested recovery procedures, so we can restore data after a failure.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL perform automated daily backups of the Firestore database.
- Backups SHALL be stored in a geographically separate location.
- Recovery procedures SHALL be documented and tested quarterly.

### Requirement 17.4: Performance Monitoring and Scalability
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want the system to perform well under load, so users can work efficiently.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL support 50+ concurrent users without degradation.
- Key performance metrics (e.g., dashboard load time, API response) SHALL be monitored in real time.
- Alerts SHALL be triggered if performance falls below thresholds.

### Requirement 17.5: 99.9% Uptime SLA
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want the platform to be highly available, so our team can rely on it for daily operations.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime over a rolling 30-day period.
- Downtime SHALL be tracked and reported monthly.
- Scheduled maintenance SHALL be communicated in advance and performed during off-peak hours.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Authentication requests SHALL complete within 2 seconds.
- Dashboard load time SHALL be under 2 seconds for 1,000+ RFQs.
- The system SHALL recover from a single-point failure within 15 minutes.

# Design Document: Feature 17 - Security & Performance

## Overview
This foundational module ensures the platform is secure, fast, and reliable. It leverages Firebase's managed services for scalability and implements enterprise-grade security practices to protect data and ensure high availability.

## Components and Interfaces

### Security Layer
- **Firebase Authentication:** Handles user sign-in with support for MFA.
- **Firestore Security Rules:** Enforce role-based access at the database level.
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** All web traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

### Performance Layer
- **Frontend Optimization:**
  - React Query for server state caching
  - Virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Lazy loading of routes and components
- **Backend Optimization:**
  - Firestore composite indexes for fast queries
  - Cloud Function cold-start mitigation
  - CDN for static assets

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit:** All communication uses TLS 1.2+.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Firestore and Cloud Storage encrypt data by default.
- **Secure Secrets:** API keys and credentials stored in Firebase Secret Manager.

### Authentication
- MFA implemented via Firebase Auth with support for TOTP and SMS.
- Session tokens are short-lived and refreshed securely.

### Backup & Recovery
- Firestore backups scheduled daily via Google Cloud Scheduler.
- Backup data stored in a different region (e.g., US â†’ EU).
- Recovery playbook includes:
  - Restore from backup
  - Validate data integrity
  - Notify stakeholders

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend
- Code splitting and lazy loading to reduce initial bundle size.
- Memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Virtual scrolling for Kanban board and RFQ list.

### Backend
- Optimized Firestore queries with composite indexes.
- Cloud Functions deployed with minimum instances to reduce cold starts.
- Caching of frequently accessed data (e.g., workflow config, supplier list).

## Monitoring & Alerting
- **Tools:** Google Cloud Operations (formerly Stackdriver), Firebase Monitoring.
- **Metrics Tracked:**
  - Dashboard load time
  - API latency
  - Error rate
  - Authentication success/failure
  - Backup success/failure
- **Alerts:** Configured for:
  - High latency (>2s)
  - High error rate (>5%)
  - Failed backups
  - Service outages

## Scalability Design
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Firebase services are inherently scalable.
- **Load Distribution:** CDN for static assets, load balancing for Cloud Functions.
- **Database:** Firestore scales automatically; sharding not required at current scale.

## Performance Targets
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds (1,000 RFQs)
- API response time: < 500ms
- Real-time update latency: < 1 second
- Search response time: < 1 second
