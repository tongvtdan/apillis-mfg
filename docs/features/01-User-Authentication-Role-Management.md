# Requirements Document: Feature 1 - User Authentication & Role Management

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the User Authentication & Role Management system, a foundational component of the Manufacturing RFQ Management Platform. This feature ensures secure access and appropriate permissions for all user roles.

## Stakeholders
- System Administrator
- Procurement Owner
- Engineering Team
- QA Team
- Production Team
- Customer
- Supplier
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1.1: Multi-Role Authentication
**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in securely so that I can access the system with appropriate permissions.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL support user authentication via email/password and Google SSO.
- The system SHALL support the following roles: Customer, Procurement Owner, Engineering, QA, Production, Supplier, Management.
- Upon login, the system SHALL redirect the user to their default dashboard based on role.

### Requirement 1.2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define access levels so that users only see what they are authorized to see.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL enforce RBAC at both UI and API levels.
- Users SHALL NOT be able to access pages or data outside their role permissions.
- Admins SHALL be able to assign and modify user roles via an admin panel.

### Requirement 1.3: Session Management
**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be secure and persistent across visits.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL maintain user sessions securely using Firebase Authentication.
- Sessions SHALL expire after 24 hours of inactivity.
- Users SHALL be able to log out from all devices.

### Requirement 1.4: Password Policy
**User Story:** As a security officer, I want strong password policies to protect user accounts.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Passwords SHALL be at least 8 characters long and include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
- The system SHALL prompt users to reset passwords every 90 days.
- Failed login attempts SHALL trigger a temporary lockout after 5 tries.

### Requirement 1.5: Audit Logging
**User Story:** As an auditor, I want to track user access and role changes.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL log all login attempts (success/failure) with timestamp, IP, and user agent.
- Role changes SHALL be logged with the modifier’s identity and timestamp.
- Logs SHALL be immutable and stored for at least 1 year.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Authentication process SHALL complete within 2 seconds under normal load.
- The system SHALL comply with GDPR and CCPA for user data handling.
- All authentication traffic SHALL be encrypted using TLS 1.2+.

# Design Document: Feature 1 - User Authentication & Role Management

## Overview
The authentication system is built on Firebase Authentication with role metadata stored in Firestore. It provides secure, scalable, and role-aware access to the platform.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components
- **Login Page:** Email/password form with Google SSO button.
- **Logout Button:** Accessible in the user profile dropdown.
- **Admin Panel > User Management:** Table view of users with role assignment controls.
- **Route Guards:** React components that check authentication and role before rendering protected routes.

### Backend Services
- **Firebase Auth:** Handles user sign-up, sign-in, and token generation.
- **Firestore:** Stores user metadata including `role`, `department`, and `status`.
- **Cloud Functions:** Triggers on user creation/update to validate and log role changes.

## Data Model
```json
users (collection)
  └── {userId} (document)
      ├── email: string
      ├── displayName: string
      ├── role: enum(Customer, Procurement, Engineering, QA, Production, Supplier, Management)
      ├── status: enum(Active, Inactive, Pending)
      ├── lastLogin: timestamp
      ├── createdAt: timestamp
      └── createdBy: reference to user
```

## Security Considerations
- All Firebase Security Rules SHALL enforce role-based read/write access.
- Custom claims SHALL be used to encode user roles for fast permission checks.
- Signed-in users SHALL only modify their own profile (except admins).

## Workflow
1. User navigates to `/login`.
2. Enters credentials or clicks Google SSO.
3. On success, Firebase returns ID token.
4. Frontend validates token, fetches user doc from Firestore.
5. Route guard checks role and redirects to appropriate dashboard.

## UI Mock Reference
- Login form follows Material Design guidelines.
- Admin user table includes search, filter by role, and bulk role assignment.
