# Requirements Document: Feature 13 - Integration & API


## Introduction
The Integration & API module enables the RFQ Management Platform to connect with external business systems such as ERP, email, and calendar services. This ensures data consistency, eliminates manual data entry, and streamlines workflows across departments.

## Stakeholders
- System Administrator
- Procurement Owner
- Finance Team
- IT Department
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 13.1: REST API for External Systems
**User Story:** As a Developer, I want a REST API to integrate the platform with external tools, so I can automate data exchange.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL expose a RESTful API (v1) with endpoints for RFQs, suppliers, quotes, and users.
- API SHALL support CRUD operations with JSON payloads.
- Authentication SHALL be via API keys or OAuth 2.0.
- Comprehensive API documentation SHALL be available (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).

### Requirement 13.2: ERP System Integration
**User Story:** As a Finance Manager, I want RFQs marked as "Won" to automatically create production orders in our ERP, so I can reduce manual work and errors.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL integrate with major ERP systems (SAP, NetSuite, Oracle).
- WHEN an RFQ status changes to "Won", the system SHALL create a production order in the ERP.
- Data mapped SHALL include: customer, part number, quantity, delivery date, and cost.
- Integration SHALL support both real-time and batch modes.

### Requirement 13.3: Email System Integration
**User Story:** As an Administrator, I want the system to use our company email server for notifications, so all communications appear consistent.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL support SMTP integration for sending emails.
- Administrators SHALL be able to configure SMTP settings (host, port, credentials).
- All system-generated emails (e.g., confirmations, assignments) SHALL use the configured SMTP server.

### Requirement 13.4: Calendar Integration
**User Story:** As a Team Member, I want key RFQ deadlines to appear in my Google Calendar, so I can manage my schedule effectively.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL integrate with Google Calendar and Outlook.
- WHEN a deadline is set or updated in an RFQ, the system SHALL create or update a calendar event.
- Events SHALL include: RFQ ID, project name, deadline type (e.g., Review, Quotation), and link to the RFQ.

### Requirement 13.5: Export Functionality
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to export RFQ data and reports, so I can analyze them in Excel or share them as PDFs.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow exporting RFQ lists, reports, and document packages.
- Export formats SHALL include Excel (.xlsx) and PDF.
- Exports SHALL respect user permissions and only include accessible data.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- API response time SHALL be under 1 second for standard operations.
- Integrations SHALL support retry logic for failed requests.
- All external communications SHALL use TLS 1.2+ encryption.
- Sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, ERP passwords) SHALL be stored in a secure secrets manager.

# Design Document: Feature 13 - Integration & API

## Overview
This module enables the RFQ Management Platform to interoperate with external systems through a secure, well-documented API and pre-built integrations. It supports automation, data synchronization, and workflow continuity across business units.

## Components and Interfaces

### Backend Services

#### 1. RESTful API (Cloud Functions as Endpoints)
```typescript
// Example Endpoints
GET    /api/v1/rfqs            // List RFQs with filters
GET    /api/v1/rfqs/{id}       // Get specific RFQ
POST   /api/v1/rfqs            // Create new RFQ
PUT    /api/v1/rfqs/{id}       // Update RFQ
DELETE /api/v1/rfqs/{id}       // Delete RFQ (soft)

// Similar for: /suppliers, /quotes, /users, /reports
```

- **Authentication:** API Keys (for systems) or OAuth 2.0 (for user-facing apps)
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests/minute per key
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI 3.0 spec hosted at `/api/docs`

#### 2. ERP Integration Service (Cloud Function)
- **Trigger:** `onRFQStatusChanged` (to "Won")
- **Process:**
  1. Transform RFQ data into ERP-specific format
  2. Call ERP API (e.g., SAP OData, NetSuite SuiteTalk)
  3. Log result (success/failure)
- **Fallback:** Queue failed requests for retry (up to 3 times)

#### 3. Calendar Integration Service (Cloud Function)
- **Trigger:** `onDeadlineCreated` or `onDeadlineUpdated`
- **Process:**
  1. Use Google Calendar API or Microsoft Graph API
  2. Create or update event with RFQ context
  3. Store event ID for future updates

#### 4. Email Integration Service
- Uses configured SMTP settings from admin panel
- Replaces SendGrid for system emails when SMTP is enabled
- Supports TLS and authentication

#### 5. Export Service
- Reuses PDF and Excel generation from Features 9 and 12
- Adds API endpoints for programmatic export
- Enforces RBAC on exported data

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- API access is role-based and key-controlled.
- Only Admin and Integration roles can configure integrations.

### Data Protection
- All API traffic encrypted with HTTPS.
- Credentials stored in Firebase Secret Manager.
- Request payloads validated and sanitized.

## Monitoring & Logging
- All API calls logged with metadata (key, IP, endpoint, response time).
- Integration failures trigger alerts to administrators.
- Logs stored for 90 days.

## Technology Stack
- **API Layer:** Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth + API Keys
- **Integrations:** Google APIs Client Library, Axios for ERP APIs
- **Documentation:** Swagger UI
- **Secrets:** Firebase Secret Manager
