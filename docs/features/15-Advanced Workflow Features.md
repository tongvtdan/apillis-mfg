# Requirements Document: Feature 15 - Advanced Workflow Features


## Introduction
The Advanced Workflow Features module extends the core workflow engine with automation, templating, and intelligent routing to handle complex, high-value, or recurring RFQs more efficiently. It reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and improves turnaround time through customizable business logic.

## Stakeholders
- Process Owner
- Procurement Owner
- Engineering Team Lead
- System Administrator
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 15.1: Automated Workflow Routing
**User Story:** As a Process Owner, I want RFQs to be routed automatically based on their characteristics, so I can streamline processing for different types of requests.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL route RFQs to appropriate teams or workflows based on attributes such as:
  - Annual volume (High/Medium/Low)
  - Technical complexity
  - Customer type
- Routing rules SHALL be configurable via the Workflow Configuration interface.
- IF no rule matches, the system SHALL fall back to a default workflow.

### Requirement 15.2: Custom Approval Chains
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to define custom approval chains for different RFQ types or values, so I can enforce appropriate oversight.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow administrators to define approval chains based on:
  - Quote value (e.g., >$50K requires VP approval)
  - Customer tier
  - Product type
- Each chain SHALL specify the sequence of approvers.
- The quote SHALL be locked during approval and only progress upon final sign-off.

### Requirement 15.3: Escalation Rules for Overdue Items
**User Story:** As a Team Lead, I want overdue tasks to escalate automatically, so I can prevent delays.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL monitor task deadlines and trigger escalations when exceeded.
- Escalation rules SHALL be configurable (e.g., after 24h overdue, notify Team Lead; after 48h, notify Manager).
- Escalations SHALL generate notifications to the designated user(s).

### Requirement 15.4: Batch Processing Capabilities
**User Story:** As a Procurement Owner, I want to manage multiple RFQs at once, so I can save time on repetitive actions.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow users to select multiple RFQs and perform batch operations such as:
  - Assign to a team member
  - Change status
  - Add to a project group
- The system SHALL confirm the action and show a summary of changes.
- Batch operations SHALL respect user permissions.

### Requirement 15.5: Template Management for Recurring RFQ Types
**User Story:** As a Procurement Owner, I want to create templates for recurring RFQ types, so I can reduce data entry and ensure consistency.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow users to save an RFQ as a template.
- Templates SHALL include: project details, technical specs, document list, workflow, and assignment rules.
- Users SHALL be able to create a new RFQ from a template with pre-filled data.
- Templates SHALL be editable and version-controlled.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Workflow rule evaluation SHALL complete within 500ms.
- Batch operations SHALL support up to 100 RFQs per action.
- All rule changes SHALL be logged for audit purposes.

# Design Document: Feature 15 - Advanced Workflow Features

## Overview
This module builds upon the core workflow engine to provide sophisticated automation, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency for complex or high-value requests. It introduces intelligent routing, dynamic approvals, and productivity-enhancing features like batching and templating.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Workflow Rule Builder
```typescript
interface WorkflowRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  conditions: Condition[];
  action: 'routeToWorkflow' | 'assignToTeam' | 'requireApprovalChain';
  target: string; // workflowId, teamId, chainId
  enabled: boolean;
}

interface Condition {
  field: 'volume' | 'complexity' | 'customerTier' | 'quoteValue';
  operator: 'greaterThan' | 'lessThan' | 'equals' | 'in';
  value: number | string;
}
```

#### 2. Batch Operations Toolbar
- Appears when multiple RFQs are selected.
- Provides dropdown for actions: Assign, Change Status, Apply Template, etc.
- Shows confirmation dialog with impact summary.

#### 3. Template Management Panel
- List view of saved templates.
- Option to create, edit, duplicate, or delete.
- Preview of template contents.

### Backend Services

#### 1. Workflow Router (Cloud Function)
- Triggered on RFQ creation.
- Evaluates all active routing rules.
- Applies first matching rule or falls back to default.

#### 2. Escalation Monitor (Scheduled Cloud Function)
- Runs every 15 minutes.
- Queries for overdue tasks (status not updated past deadline).
- Triggers escalation notifications based on rule depth.

#### 3. Batch Processor (Cloud Function)
- Accepts list of RFQ IDs and an operation.
- Processes each RFQ with error isolation (partial success allowed).
- Returns summary of successes and failures.

## Data Model

### Workflow Rules Collection
```json
workflowRules (collection)
  â””â”€â”€ {ruleId}
      â”œâ”€â”€ name: string
      â”œâ”€â”€ conditions: array of { field, operator, value }
      â”œâ”€â”€ action: string
      â”œâ”€â”€ target: string
      â”œâ”€â”€ priority: number
      â”œâ”€â”€ enabled: boolean
      â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: timestamp
      â””â”€â”€ createdBy: string
```

### RFQ Templates Collection
```json
rfqTemplates (collection)
  â””â”€â”€ {templateId}
      â”œâ”€â”€ name: string
      â”œâ”€â”€ description: string
      â”œâ”€â”€ rfqData: object // Full RFQ snapshot
      â”œâ”€â”€ applicableTo: string[] // e.g., ["CNC", "Sheet Metal"]
      â”œâ”€â”€ version: number
      â”œâ”€â”€ createdAt: timestamp
      â””â”€â”€ createdBy: string
```

## Security Considerations
- Only users with `Admin` or `Process Owner` roles can create or edit rules and templates.
- Batch operations validate permissions for each RFQ.
- All changes are logged in the audit trail.

## Performance Optimization
- Workflow rules are cached and indexed for fast evaluation.
- Batch operations use Firestore batch writes where possible.
- Escalation checks are optimized with composite indexes.
