# Requirements Document: Feature 14 - Mobile Application



## Introduction
The Mobile Application extends the RFQ Management Platform to smartphones and tablets, enabling users to manage RFQs from anywhere â€” including the factory floor or while traveling. It supports offline access, push notifications, and touch-optimized workflows to ensure productivity regardless of connectivity.

## Stakeholders
- Procurement Owner
- Engineering Team
- QA Team
- Production Team
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 14.1: Mobile-Responsive Design
**User Story:** As a User, I want to access the platform on my mobile device, so I can manage RFQs while on the go.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL provide a responsive web interface that adapts to screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Layouts SHALL reflow for vertical scrolling on small screens.
- Navigation SHALL switch to a hamburger menu or tab bar on mobile.

### Requirement 14.2: Dedicated Mobile App with Offline Capability
**User Story:** As a QA Inspector on the factory floor, I want to access and update RFQs without internet, so I can work in areas with poor connectivity.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL offer a dedicated mobile app (iOS and Android) via app stores.
- Users SHALL be able to view, edit, and save RFQ data while offline.
- When connectivity is restored, the system SHALL automatically synchronize changes with the server.

### Requirement 14.3: Mobile-Optimized Review Workflows
**User Story:** As an Engineer, I want to submit reviews on my tablet, so I can do it from the production line.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Review forms SHALL be optimized for touch input (larger buttons, swipe gestures).
- The UI SHALL support simplified navigation for common tasks (e.g., update status, attach photo, submit review).
- Document viewer SHALL support pinch-to-zoom and swipe for multi-page files.

### Requirement 14.4: Tablet Support for Factory Floor Use
**User Story:** As a Production Supervisor, I want to use a tablet on the shop floor to track RFQ progress, so I can coordinate with my team.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The interface SHALL be optimized for 7â€“12" tablets in landscape mode.
- Forms and dashboards SHALL support split-screen layouts.
- Touch targets SHALL be large enough for use with gloves.

### Requirement 14.5: Push Notifications
**User Story:** As a Team Member, I want to receive push notifications on my phone, so I donâ€™t miss urgent assignments or deadlines.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL send push notifications for:
  - New RFQ assignments
  - Approaching deadlines (2h before)
  - Overdue tasks
  - Status changes
- Notifications SHALL open the relevant RFQ when tapped.
- Users SHALL be able to manage notification preferences in-app.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The mobile app SHALL load within 2 seconds on 4G or Wi-Fi.
- Offline mode SHALL support all core functions except file uploads.
- Data stored locally on the device SHALL be encrypted.

# Design Document: Feature 14 - Mobile Application

## Overview
The Mobile Application ensures that users can access the RFQ Management Platform from any device, anywhere. It combines a responsive web interface with a native-capable app using PWA (Progressive Web App) principles, enabling offline access, push notifications, and factory-floor usability.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Responsive Design System
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts.
- Breakpoints for mobile (<768px), tablet (768â€“1024px), desktop (>1024px).
- Touch-optimized controls (larger buttons, swipe gestures).

#### 2. Offline-First Architecture
```typescript
interface OfflineSyncService {
  cacheData(rfq: RFQ): Promise<void>;
  getFromCache(rfqId: string): RFQ | null;
  syncPendingChanges(): Promise<void>;
  onConnectivityChange(online: boolean): void;
}
```
- Uses Service Workers and IndexedDB for local storage.
- Tracks pending sync operations.

#### 3. Push Notification Integration
- Integrates with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- Handles background and foreground notifications.
- Deep links to RFQ detail page.

#### 4. Mobile-Optimized Workflows
- Simplified forms and navigation for common tasks.
- Optimized document viewer for mobile screens.
- Camera integration for photo uploads (e.g., inspection evidence).

### Backend Services

#### 1. Synchronization Service (Cloud Function)
- Handles bidirectional sync between client cache and Firestore.
- Resolves conflicts (e.g., same RFQ edited online and offline).
- Uses timestamp-based or version-vector conflict resolution.

#### 2. Push Notification Gateway
- Sends FCM messages on key events.
- Respects user notification preferences.

## Data Model
- No new collections; uses existing `rfqs`, `users`, `notifications`.
- Adds `lastSyncedAt` timestamp to user profile.
- Adds `isOfflinePending` flag to local RFQ records.

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Mobile app uses the same Firebase Auth for user identity.
- All API calls are authenticated and authorized.

### Data Protection
- Data stored in the local cache on the device is encrypted.
- Session tokens are stored securely using platform-specific secure storage.

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of non-critical assets.
- Image compression for photo uploads.
- Background sync to avoid blocking UI.

## Testing Strategy
- Test offline workflows on real devices.
- Simulate poor network conditions.
- Validate push notification delivery and deep linking.
