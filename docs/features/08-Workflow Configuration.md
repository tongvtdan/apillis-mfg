# Requirements Document: Feature 8 - Workflow Configuration

## Introduction
The Workflow Configuration feature allows System Administrators to define and modify the RFQ workflow stages, transitions, and business rules without requiring code changes or system restarts. This ensures the platform can adapt to evolving business processes and departmental requirements while maintaining consistency and auditability.

## Stakeholders
- System Administrator
- Process Owner
- Procurement Owner
- Management

## Requirements

### Requirement 8.1: Configure Workflow Stages
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to configure workflow stages (names, colors, order, required roles), so I can tailor the process to our business needs.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL provide an admin interface to add, edit, and delete workflow stages.
- Administrators SHALL be able to set stage name, description, color, and display order.
- Each stage SHALL support defining required user roles for interaction (e.g., only Engineering can edit in Technical Review).
- Changes SHALL be applied immediately and reflected in the Kanban board.

### Requirement 8.2: Define Valid Transitions Between Stages
**User Story:** As a Process Owner, I want to define valid transitions between workflow stages, so I can enforce process compliance.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow administrators to define which stage transitions are permitted.
- Invalid transitions (e.g., skipping QA Review) SHALL be blocked in the UI and API.
- The transition rules SHALL be enforced during drag-and-drop operations on the Kanban board.

### Requirement 8.3: Configure Business Rules
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to configure business rules (e.g., priority scoring, auto-transitions), so the system can automate key processes.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL allow configuration of rules such as:
  - Priority scoring formula (based on volume, margin, complexity)
  - Auto-transition rules (e.g., auto-move to Quotation if all reviews are approved)
- Rules SHALL be evaluated in real time as RFQs progress.
- The system SHALL support rule testing before activation.

### Requirement 8.4: Validate Configuration Changes
**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want the system to validate my configuration changes, so I donâ€™t create an invalid workflow.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a configuration change is saved, the system SHALL validate it for logical consistency.
- Validation SHALL include:
  - No circular transitions
  - At least one starting and ending stage
  - No duplicate stage names
- IF validation fails, the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent save.

### Requirement 8.5: Audit Logging of Configuration Changes
**User Story:** As an Auditor, I want to track all workflow configuration changes, so I can ensure compliance and traceability.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL log all configuration changes with:
  - Timestamp
  - Administrator ID
  - Description of change
  - Reason (optional)
- Logs SHALL be immutable and stored for at least 1 year.
- Logs SHALL be accessible to Admin and Audit roles only.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Configuration changes SHALL be applied in real time across all clients.
- The admin interface SHALL load within 2 seconds.
- The system SHALL support role-based access control: only Admin and Process Owner roles can access the configuration panel.

### `design-feature8.md`

## Overview
This feature provides an admin interface for dynamically configuring the RFQ workflow. It allows administrators to define stages, transitions, and business rules without code changes, enabling the system to evolve with business needs while maintaining process integrity and auditability.

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Admin Configuration Panel
```typescript
interface AdminConfigPanelProps {
  workflowConfig: WorkflowConfig;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  onSave: (updatedConfig: WorkflowConfig) => Promise<void>;
  onReset: () => void;
}
```

#### 2. Workflow Stage Editor
```typescript
interface StageEditorProps {
  stage: WorkflowStage;
  onChange: (updatedStage: WorkflowStage) => void;
  onDelete: (stageId: string) => void;
  onMove: (stageId: string, direction: 'up' | 'down') => void;
  availableRoles: UserRole[];
  availableTransitions: RFQStatus[];
}
```

#### 3. Business Rules Editor
```typescript
interface RulesEditorProps {
  rules: BusinessRule[];
  onChange: (updatedRules: BusinessRule[]) => void;
  onAddRule: () => void;
  onDeleteRule: (ruleId: string) => void;
}
```

### Backend Services

#### 1. Workflow Configuration Service
```typescript
interface ConfigUpdateRequest {
  updatedWorkflowConfig: WorkflowConfig;
  updatedByUserId: string;
  changeReason?: string;
}

interface ConfigUpdateResponse {
  success: boolean;
  updatedConfig?: WorkflowConfig;
  validationErrors?: ValidationError[];
}
```

#### 2. Configuration Validation Engine
- Validates for:
  - Circular transitions
  - Missing start/end stages
  - Duplicate stage names
  - Invalid role references

## Database Schema

### Workflow Configuration Document
```json
workflowConfig (document)
  â”œâ”€â”€ configId: "default"
  â”œâ”€â”€ version: 2
  â”œâ”€â”€ stages: [
    {
      id: "technical-review",
      name: "Technical Review",
      description: "Engineering assessment",
      color: "#FFA500",
      order: 2,
      requiredRoles: ["engineering"],
      autoTransitions: [
        {
          condition: "allReviewsApproved",
          targetStage: "qa-review"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  â”œâ”€â”€ transitions: [
    {
      fromStageId: "inquiry",
      toStageId: "technical-review"
    },
    {
      fromStageId: "technical-review",
      toStageId: "qa-review"
    }
  ]
  â”œâ”€â”€ businessRules: [
    {
      id: "priority-scoring",
      type: "priority",
      expression: "volume * 0.4 + margin * 0.3 + complexity * 0.3"
    }
  ]
  â”œâ”€â”€ slaTargets: [
    {
      phase: "technical-review",
      maxTimeInPhase: 72 // hours
    }
  ]
  â”œâ”€â”€ lastUpdated: timestamp
  â”œâ”€â”€ updatedBy: "admin123"
  â””â”€â”€ auditLog: [
    {
      timestamp: timestamp,
      userId: "admin123",
      action: "stage.updated",
      details: "Changed color of Technical Review to orange",
      changeReason: "Improved visual clarity"
    }
  ]
```

## Workflow
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/workflow`.
2. Edits stages, transitions, or rules.
3. Clicks "Save".
4. Frontend sends config to `updateWorkflowConfig` Cloud Function.
5. Function validates, applies changes, logs update.
6. All clients receive real-time update via Firestore listener.

## Security Considerations
- Only users with `Admin` or `Process Owner` roles can access the configuration panel.
- All changes are logged and immutable.
- Firestore Security Rules enforce role-based access.

## Performance Optimization
- Active configuration is cached for fast access.
- Real-time updates use Firestore listeners.
- Validation is performed server-side to prevent tampering.

## Monitoring Metrics
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  configSaveTime: number; // ms
  configLoadTime: number; // ms
  validationTime: number; // ms
  errorRate: number; // %
}
```
