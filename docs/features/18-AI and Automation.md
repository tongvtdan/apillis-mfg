# Requirements Document: Feature 18 - AI & Automation


## Introduction
The AI & Automation module leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and predictive capabilities of the RFQ Management Platform. It automates complex, time-consuming tasks such as document parsing and complexity assessment, reducing manual effort and accelerating the quote process.

## Stakeholders
- Procurement Owner
- Engineering Team
- Management
- IT/ML Engineer

## Requirements

### Requirement 18.1: AI-Powered Complexity Scoring
**User Story:** As a Procurement Owner, I want the system to automatically assess the technical complexity of an incoming RFQ, so I can prioritize and route it appropriately.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a customer uploads CAD files (STEP, IGES) or drawings (PDF), the system SHALL analyze them using AI.
- The system SHALL generate a complexity score (1â€“10) based on geometric features, tolerances, and process requirements.
- The score SHALL be displayed in the RFQ detail view and used to influence the priority score.

### Requirement 18.2: Automated Document Parsing and Data Extraction
**User Story:** As a User, I want the system to extract key data from customer files, so I donâ€™t have to manually enter BOMs or specifications.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- WHEN a BOM (XLSX, CSV) or drawing (PDF) is uploaded, the system SHALL use OCR and NLP to extract:
  - Part numbers
  - Quantities
  - Materials
  - Tolerances
  - Process notes
- Extracted data SHALL be pre-filled into the RFQ form.
- Users SHALL be able to review and correct the parsed data before submission.

### Requirement 18.3: Predictive Analytics for Lead Times and Delays
**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to predict potential delays, so I can proactively manage customer expectations.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL use historical data and machine learning to predict the total lead time for an RFQ.
- IF a delay is likely (e.g., due to supplier backlog or internal bottlenecks), the system SHALL flag it with a confidence level.
- Predictions SHALL be updated as new data becomes available.

### Requirement 18.4: Smart Supplier Recommendations
**User Story:** As a Procurement Owner, I want the system to recommend suitable suppliers, so I can reduce sourcing time.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL analyze the required processes, materials, volume, and location.
- Based on supplier performance history and capabilities, the system SHALL generate a ranked list of recommended suppliers.
- Recommendations SHALL include a confidence score and rationale.

### Requirement 18.5: Automated Risk Assessment
**User Story:** As a QA Lead, I want the system to identify potential risks in an RFQ, so I can address them early.  
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system SHALL scan RFQ data and documents for risk indicators (e.g., tight tolerances, exotic materials, short timelines).
- It SHALL generate an automated risk assessment report with severity levels and mitigation suggestions.
- The report SHALL be visible to all relevant teams.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- AI model inference SHALL complete within 10 seconds for standard files.
- All AI services SHALL be optional and can be disabled by administrators.
- Model training data SHALL be anonymized and secured.

# Design Document: Feature 18 - AI & Automation

## Overview
This module integrates artificial intelligence and machine learning services to automate complex, time-consuming tasks and provide proactive insights, transforming the platform from reactive to predictive. It uses Google Cloud AI, Vertex AI, or similar platforms for model hosting and inference.

## Components and Interfaces

### Backend Services

#### 1. AI Complexity Scoring Service (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Uploaded CAD files (STEP, IGES), 2D drawings (PDF).
- **Process:** Uses a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., on Google Cloud AI Platform) to analyze geometric complexity, tolerance requirements, and feature count.
- **Output:** A complexity score (1â€“10) and explanation.

#### 2. Document Parsing & Data Extraction Service (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** BOMs (XLSX, CSV), technical drawings (PDF).
- **Process:** Uses OCR (Tesseract, Google Document AI) and NLP to extract structured data.
- **Output:** JSON object with extracted fields (partNumber, qty, material, etc.).

#### 3. Predictive Analytics Engine (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** RFQ characteristics, historical lead times, supplier performance.
- **Process:** Uses a time-series forecasting model to predict the total lead time for the project.
- **Output:** A predicted lead time with a confidence interval.

#### 4. Smart Supplier Recommendation Engine (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** Required processes, materials, volume, location, and supplier performance data.
- **Process:** Uses a recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering) to rank suppliers.
- **Output:** A list of recommended suppliers with a confidence score.

#### 5. Automated Risk Assessment Service (Cloud Function)
- **Input:** RFQ data, documents, timeline, complexity score.
- **Process:** Applies a rule-based or ML model to identify risk factors.
- **Output:** Risk report with severity, category, and suggested actions.

## Data Model

### AI Insights Sub-collection
```json
rfqs/{rfqId}/aiInsights/{insightId}
  â”œâ”€â”€ type: "complexityScore" | "extractedData" | "leadTimePrediction" | "supplierRecommendation" | "riskAssessment"
  â”œâ”€â”€ data: object // structured output from AI service
  â”œâ”€â”€ confidence: number // 0.0 - 1.0
  â”œâ”€â”€ generatedAt: timestamp
  â”œâ”€â”€ modelVersion: string
  â””â”€â”€ status: "pending" | "completed" | "failed"
```

## Security Considerations
- AI services run in a secure Google Cloud environment.
- All file uploads are scanned before processing.
- Parsed data is treated with the same security as manually entered data.

## Performance Optimization
- AI services are asynchronous; results are delivered via real-time updates.
- Results are cached to avoid reprocessing.
- Model inference is optimized for latency.

## Testing Strategy
- Validate model accuracy with known test datasets.
- Test OCR extraction on low-quality scans.
- Mock AI service failures and verify graceful degradation.
