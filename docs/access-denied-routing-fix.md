# Access Denied Routing Fix

## Issue Summary

The "Go to Dashboard" button in the Access Denied dialog was causing a 404 error instead of properly navigating to the dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing Route**: The `ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES` configuration was pointing management and admin users to `/admin/dashboard`, but this route was not defined in the application's routing configuration.

2. **Navigation Method**: The component was using `window.location.href` instead of React Router's navigation, which can cause issues with single-page application routing.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Fixed Default Routes Configuration

**File**: `src/lib/auth-constants.ts`

Updated the `ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES` to point all user roles to the existing `/dashboard` route:

```typescript
export const ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES = {
    sales: '/dashboard',
    procurement: '/dashboard', 
    engineering: '/dashboard',
    qa: '/dashboard',
    production: '/dashboard',
    management: '/dashboard',    // Changed from '/admin/dashboard'
    admin: '/dashboard',         // Changed from '/admin/dashboard'
} as const;
```

### ✅ Improved Navigation Implementation

**File**: `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

1. **Added React Router Navigation**:
   - Imported `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom`
   - Added `navigate` hook to component

2. **Updated Button Handlers**:
   - Replaced `window.location.href = getDefaultRoute()` with `navigate(getDefaultRoute())`
   - Applied fix to all three access denied scenarios:
     - Route-based access denial
     - Role-based access denial (legacy)
     - Permission-based access denial

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **✅ Eliminates 404 Errors**: All users now get directed to an existing route
2. **✅ Consistent Navigation**: All user roles use the same dashboard route
3. **✅ Better UX**: Uses proper React Router navigation for smoother transitions
4. **✅ Maintainable**: Centralized route configuration that's easier to manage

## Testing Verification

### Scenarios Tested:
- ✅ Management user accessing restricted route → Access denied → "Go to Dashboard" works
- ✅ Admin user accessing restricted route → Access denied → "Go to Dashboard" works  
- ✅ Regular user accessing admin-only route → Access denied → "Go to Dashboard" works
- ✅ User with insufficient permissions → Access denied → "Go to Dashboard" works

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ "Go Back" button: Uses browser history to go back
- ✅ "Go to Dashboard" button: Navigates to `/dashboard` using React Router

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/auth-constants.ts` - Updated default routes configuration
2. `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Improved navigation implementation

## Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No build errors or warnings
- ✅ All navigation hooks properly imported and configured

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Impact**: High - Fixes critical navigation issue affecting user experience  
**Risk**: Low - Simple configuration change with no breaking changes
