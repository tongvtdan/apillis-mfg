# Database Cleanup Summary: Customer/Supplier Users Removal

## Issue Identified
The local Supabase database had **3 customer/supplier accounts** incorrectly created in the `users` table when they should only exist in the `contacts` table.

## Problem Details
According to the database schema:
- **`users` table**: For internal employees only (admin, management, sales, engineering, qa, production, procurement)
- **`contacts` table**: For external entities (customers, suppliers, partners)

## Customer/Supplier Users Removed
1. **Customer**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440104` - `procurement@airbus.vn` (Phạm Thị Dung) - role: `customer`
2. **Supplier 1**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440106` - `sales@precision-machining.vn` (Trần Văn Phúc) - role: `supplier`
3. **Supplier 2**: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440110` - `sales@electronics-assembly.vn` (Vũ Đình Nam) - role: `supplier`

## Database References Updated
- **3 projects** had these users as assignees → Updated to internal engineering employees
- **17 projects** had supplier user as creator → Updated to sales manager
- **94 activity log entries** referenced these users → Updated to appropriate internal employees

## Verification Results
- ✅ **0 projects** assigned to customer/supplier users
- ✅ **0 projects** created by customer/supplier users  
- ✅ **0 activity log entries** reference customer/supplier users
- ✅ **0 customer/supplier users** remaining in users table
- ✅ **3 entities** still exist in contacts table (preserved)

## Current State
- **Users table**: 15 internal employees only
- **Contacts table**: External entities properly stored
- **Data integrity**: All foreign key relationships valid
- **Schema compliance**: Proper separation between internal and external entities

## SQL Script Used
The fix was applied using `scripts/fix-customer-supplier-users.sql` which:
1. Updated project assignments to internal employees
2. Updated project creators to internal employees  
3. Updated activity log entries to internal employees
4. Removed customer/supplier users from users table
5. Verified all references were properly updated
