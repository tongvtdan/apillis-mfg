# Workflow Definitions

## Overview

Workflow Definitions provide a powerful way to manage versioned, reusable workflow templates that can be applied to projects in Factory Pulse. This feature allows organizations to create standardized workflows with customized stages and sub-stages that can be reused across multiple projects.

## Key Features

- **Versioned Templates**: Create and manage multiple versions of workflow templates
- **Organization-Specific**: Each organization can have its own workflow definitions
- **Flexible Overrides**: Customize stage properties per workflow definition
- **Reusable Templates**: Apply the same workflow template to multiple projects
- **Admin Management**: Full CRUD operations for workflow definitions through the admin interface

## Components

### 1. WorkflowDefinitionService

The [WorkflowDefinitionService](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/factory-pulse/src/services/workflowDefinitionService.ts) provides the core functionality for managing workflow definitions:

- `getDefaultWorkflowDefinition(organizationId)`: Get the default workflow definition for an organization
- `getWorkflowDefinitionById(id)`: Retrieve a specific workflow definition by ID
- `getWorkflowDefinitionStages(workflowDefinitionId)`: Get stages associated with a workflow definition
- `getWorkflowDefinitionSubStages(workflowDefinitionId)`: Get sub-stages associated with a workflow definition
- `createWorkflowDefinition(definitionData)`: Create a new workflow definition
- `updateWorkflowDefinition(id, updates)`: Update an existing workflow definition
- `linkStagesToDefinition(workflowDefinitionId, stageIds)`: Link workflow stages to a definition
- `applyDefinitionOverrides(workflowDefinitionId, baseStages)`: Apply definition-specific overrides to base stages

### 2. Database Schema

The implementation uses three main tables:

- `workflow_definitions`: Stores versioned workflow templates
- `workflow_definition_stages`: Links stages to definitions with override capabilities
- `workflow_definition_sub_stages`: Links sub-stages to definitions with override capabilities

### 3. Admin UI

The Workflow Definition Management component in the admin panel provides a user-friendly interface for:

- Creating new workflow definitions
- Editing existing workflow definitions
- Duplicating workflow definitions
- Deleting workflow definitions
- Managing stage assignments for each definition

### 4. Project Creation Integration

When creating new projects, users can now select from available workflow definitions, which will automatically:

- Assign the selected workflow definition to the project
- Set the initial workflow stage based on the definition
- Apply any stage overrides defined in the workflow template

## Usage

### Creating Workflow Definitions

1. Navigate to the Admin panel â†’ Workflows tab
2. Click "New Definition"
3. Enter the definition name, version, and description
4. Select the workflow stages to include in this definition
5. Save the definition

### Using Workflow Definitions in Projects

1. When creating a new project, select a workflow definition from the dropdown
2. The project will be created with the selected workflow template
3. The initial stage will be set according to the workflow definition

### Managing Workflow Definitions

Administrators can:
- Edit existing definitions to update names, descriptions, or versions
- Duplicate definitions to create new versions
- Delete unused definitions
- View all definitions in a table with status and stage information

## Benefits

This implementation provides several key benefits:

- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent workflows across projects
- **Flexibility**: Customize workflows for different project types
- **Version Control**: Track changes to workflow templates over time
- **Efficiency**: Reduce setup time for new projects
- **Governance**: Maintain control over approved workflow processes
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple workflow definitions per organization

## Technical Implementation

The workflow definition system integrates with the existing project workflow service to ensure seamless operation:

- Projects created with workflow definitions automatically use the appropriate initial stage
- Stage overrides are applied when projects use specific workflow definitions
- Caching mechanisms improve performance for frequently accessed definitions
- Backward compatibility is maintained with projects that don't use workflow definitions
