As an experienced UI/UX designer focused on industrial digital platforms, I recommend simplifying the **Factory Pulse** theme design system by adopting a **unified, adaptive theme architecture**â€”a single, flexible design system that works seamlessly across both light and dark environments, without requiring fully separate themes. This approach reduces development overhead, ensures visual consistency, and improves maintainabilityâ€”especially critical in manufacturing environments where reliability and clarity are paramount.

### âœ… **Recommended Theme Design System: Blue-Based Adaptive Design (BBAD)**

#### **1. Core Principle: One Theme, Adaptive Behavior**
Instead of maintaining two distinct themes (light/dark), adopt a **single theme with dynamic color semantics** that adapts to ambient lighting or user preference via CSS media queries (`prefers-color-scheme`) or runtime detection (e.g., time of day, device settings).

This is aligned with modern design trends seen in:
- **Microsoft Fluent Design** â€“ uses neutral palettes with subtle elevation and adaptive lighting.
- **Google Material You (Material 3)** â€“ emphasizes dynamic color and tone-based theming.
- **Siemens Industrial Edge**, **GE Digital's Proficy**, and **Rockwell Automation** dashboards â€“ all use high-contrast, neutral-grayscale bases with accent colors for status and alerts.

#### **2. Color Strategy: Blue Primary + Semantic Accents**

| Element                | Color Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Background**         | `#F8F9FA` (Light mode fallback) / `#1E1E1E` (Dark adaptation via tone shift)                                                                                                                                        | Use a **neutral grayscale base** that shifts subtly based on environment. Avoid pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or black (`#000000`) to reduce eye strain. |
| **Surface**            | Slight elevation contrast (e.g., `#FFFFFF` / `#2A2A2A`)                                                                                                                                                             | Cards and panels adjust tone based on context, not full theme switch.                                                                             |
| **Text & Icons**       | Dynamic text: `#212529` (light), `#E9ECEF` (dark)                                                                                                                                                                   | High readability with automatic contrast adjustment. Use `color-scheme: light dark;` in CSS.                                                      |
| **Accent Colors**      | **Primary:** `#1E40AF` (Dark Blue from image) <br> **Secondary:** `#3B82F6` (Medium Blue) <br> **Accent:** `#60A5FA` (Light Blue) <br> **Success:** `#059669` <br> **Warning:** `#D97706` <br> **Error:** `#DC2626` | Blue-based color system derived from landing page image reference, providing trust and professionalism in manufacturing UIs.                      |
| **Interactive States** | Use **opacity shifts** and **subtle shadows**, not hue changes                                                                                                                                                      | Ensures consistency across modes.                                                                                                                 |

> ðŸ”¹ **Key Innovation**: Use **blue-based theming** derived from the landing page image reference, where the primary blue (`#1E40AF`) serves as the foundation for buttons, selected items, and primary UI elements, creating a cohesive and professional appearance.

#### **3. Typography & Spacing: Clarity First**
- **Font**: Use a clean, legible sans-serif (e.g., **Inter**, **Roboto**, or **SF Pro**) with good monospace support for data.
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - Large cards with ample padding
  - Clear typographic scale (e.g., 16px base, 24px headings)
  - High line height (1.5+) for readability on factory floor tablets
- **Icons**: Stroke-based, consistent weight, paired with labels for quick recognition.

---

#### **4. Component Design: Blue-Based, Not Dual**
Instead of building two versions of each component:
- Use **CSS custom properties (variables)** with `prefers-color-scheme`
- Define **semantic tokens** like `--bg-surface`, `--text-primary`, which resolve dynamically
- Apply **blue primary color** (`#1E40AF`) for buttons, selected items, and primary actions
- Apply **subtle elevation** (soft shadows or borders) to maintain depth without strong contrast

Example:
```css
:root {
  --bg-surface: #FFFFFF;
  --text-primary: #212529;
  --border-subtle: #E0E0E0;
  --primary-blue: #1E40AF;
  --secondary-blue: #3B82F6;
  --accent-blue: #60A5FA;
  color-scheme: light;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg-surface: #1E1E1E;
    --text-primary: #E9ECEF;
    --border-subtle: #404040;
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
```

This ensures **one codebase, one design token set**, but adapts natively while maintaining the blue primary color system.

#### **5. Real-World Adaptation: Factory Floor Considerations**
Manufacturing environments often have:
- Harsh lighting (overhead fluorescents, shadows)
- Use of tablets or wall-mounted displays
- Gloved interaction

Thus:
- **Contrast Ratio**: Maintain **minimum 4.5:1** for text (WCAG AA)
- **Avoid pure black backgrounds** in dark modeâ€”they can cause "halo effect" on screens
- Use **blue primary color** (`#1E40AF`) for primary actions and selected states
- **QR code modal** (as seen in your reference) should have **light background with dark QR** for print/scanning reliability

---

#### **6. Implementation Roadmap**
1. **âœ… Audit existing theme variables** and consolidate into semantic tokens
2. **âœ… Define a blue-based primary palette** with adaptive behavior
3. **âœ… Migrate components** to use dynamic tokens with blue primary color
4. **Test on real devices** in factory lighting conditions
5. **Add user toggle** (optional): Let users force light/dark if needed, but default to OS preference

### ðŸŽ¨ **Current Implementation Status**

The blue-based theme system has been successfully implemented with:

- **Primary Color**: `#1E40AF` (Dark Blue from image reference)
- **Secondary Color**: `#3B82F6` (Medium Blue)
- **Accent Color**: `#60A5FA` (Light Blue)
- **Comprehensive Blue Palette**: 50-950 variants for consistent theming
- **Updated Components**: Toast, buttons, and UI elements now use blue primary color
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Full integration with Tailwind CSS and existing theme system
- **Accessibility Compliance**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA requirements

The system maintains the adaptive behavior while providing a cohesive blue-based visual identity that matches the landing page design reference.
