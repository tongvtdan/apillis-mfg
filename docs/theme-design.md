As an experienced UI/UX designer focused on industrial digital platforms, I recommend simplifying the **Factory Pulse** theme design system by adopting a **unified, adaptive theme architecture**â€”a single, flexible design system that works seamlessly across both light and dark environments, without requiring fully separate themes. This approach reduces development overhead, ensures visual consistency, and improves maintainabilityâ€”especially critical in manufacturing environments where reliability and clarity are paramount.

### âœ… **Recommended Theme Design System: Adaptive Neutral Design (AND)**

#### **1. Core Principle: One Theme, Adaptive Behavior**
Instead of maintaining two distinct themes (light/dark), adopt a **single theme with dynamic color semantics** that adapts to ambient lighting or user preference via CSS media queries (`prefers-color-scheme`) or runtime detection (e.g., time of day, device settings).

This is aligned with modern design trends seen in:
- **Microsoft Fluent Design** â€“ uses neutral palettes with subtle elevation and adaptive lighting.
- **Google Material You (Material 3)** â€“ emphasizes dynamic color and tone-based theming.
- **Siemens Industrial Edge**, **GE Digitalâ€™s Proficy**, and **Rockwell Automation** dashboards â€“ all use high-contrast, neutral-grayscale bases with accent colors for status and alerts.

#### **2. Color Strategy: Neutral Base + Semantic Accents**

| Element             | Color Recommendation                          | Rationale |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Background**      | `#F8F9FA` (Light mode fallback) / `#1E1E1E` (Dark adaptation via tone shift) | Use a **neutral grayscale base** that shifts subtly based on environment. Avoid pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or black (`#000000`) to reduce eye strain. |
| **Surface**         | Slight elevation contrast (e.g., `#FFFFFF` / `#2A2A2A`) | Cards and panels adjust tone based on context, not full theme switch. |
| **Text & Icons**    | Dynamic text: `#212529` (light), `#E9ECEF` (dark) | High readability with automatic contrast adjustment. Use `color-scheme: light dark;` in CSS. |
| **Accent Colors**   | **Primary:** `#0066CC` (Industrial Blue) <br> **Success:** `#009966` <br> **Warning:** `#FF9900` <br> **Error:** `#CC0033` | Industry-standard colors for status clarity under all lighting. Blue is trusted in manufacturing UIs. |
| **Interactive States** | Use **opacity shifts** and **subtle shadows**, not hue changes | Ensures consistency across modes. |

> ðŸ”¹ **Key Innovation**: Use **tone-based theming** (like Material 3) where the *same semantic token* (e.g., `surface`, `on-surface`) maps to different physical colors depending on environment.

#### **3. Typography & Spacing: Clarity First**
- **Font**: Use a clean, legible sans-serif (e.g., **Inter**, **Roboto**, or **SF Pro**) with good monospace support for data.
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - Large cards with ample padding
  - Clear typographic scale (e.g., 16px base, 24px headings)
  - High line height (1.5+) for readability on factory floor tablets
- **Icons**: Stroke-based, consistent weight, paired with labels for quick recognition.

---

#### **4. Component Design: Adaptive, Not Dual**
Instead of building two versions of each component:
- Use **CSS custom properties (variables)** with `prefers-color-scheme`
- Define **semantic tokens** like `--bg-surface`, `--text-primary`, which resolve dynamically
- Apply **subtle elevation** (soft shadows or borders) to maintain depth without strong contrast

Example:
```css
:root {
  --bg-surface: #FFFFFF;
  --text-primary: #212529;
  --border-subtle: #E0E0E0;
  color-scheme: light;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg-surface: #1E1E1E;
    --text-primary: #E9ECEF;
    --border-subtle: #404040;
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
```

This ensures **one codebase, one design token set**, but adapts natively.

#### **5. Real-World Adaptation: Factory Floor Considerations**
Manufacturing environments often have:
- Harsh lighting (overhead fluorescents, shadows)
- Use of tablets or wall-mounted displays
- Gloved interaction

Thus:
- **Contrast Ratio**: Maintain **minimum 4.5:1** for text (WCAG AA)
- **Avoid pure black backgrounds** in dark modeâ€”they can cause "halo effect" on screens
- Use **accent color sparingly** for alerts and KPIs (e.g., machine downtime = red pulse)
- **QR code modal** (as seen in your reference) should have **light background with dark QR** for print/scanning reliability

---

#### **6. Implementation Roadmap**
1. **Audit existing theme variables** and consolidate into semantic tokens
2. **Define a neutral base palette** with adaptive behavior
3. **Migrate components** to use dynamic tokens
4. **Test on real devices** in factory lighting conditions
5. **Add user toggle** (optional): Let users force light/dark if needed, but default to OS preference

### âœ… Benefits of This Approach
| Benefit | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Reduced Maintenance** | No duplicate theme files or sync issues |
| **Consistent UX** | Same look and feel across devices and modes |
| **Better Accessibility** | Automatic adaptation to user needs |
| **Faster Development** | One theme to update, test, and deploy |
| **Future-Proof** | Aligns with Material 3, Fluent, and industrial design trends |

### ðŸ“± Bonus: Mobile App Alignment
Since Factory Pulse has a mobile app (QR code suggests Android/iOS download):
- Ensure the **web and app share the same design tokens**
- Use **platform-native theme detection** (iOS/Android dark mode)
- Keep the **QR modal simple**: white background, black QR, clear headline (as in current design)

---

### Conclusion
Replace the dual theme system with a **single, adaptive, neutral-toned design system** using semantic color tokens and dynamic theming. This reduces complexity, improves usability in industrial environments, and aligns with modern design standards in manufacturing tech.

**Recommended Name**: **Factory Pulse Adaptive Theme (FP-AT)**  
**Tagline**: *One interface. Every environment.*
