# backup-files-deletion-20250922 - Backup Files Cleanup

## Context
Maintenance operation to clean up backup files in the Factory Pulse project.

## Problem/Situation
The backups directory contained multiple backup files from different dates that were no longer needed, taking up unnecessary disk space.

## Solution/Changes
Deleted all backup files from the `/backups/` directory including:
- All remote database backup files (.sql)
- All backup summary files (.md)
- Complete database dumps
- Schema-only backups
- Data-only backups

## Technical Details
- **Directory:** `/Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/factory-pulse/backups/`
- **Files Deleted:**
  - 4 complete backup files (factory_pulse_remote_complete_backup_*.sql)
  - 4 schema backup files (factory_pulse_remote_schema_backup_*.sql)
  - 3 data backup files (factory_pulse_remote_data_backup_*.sql)
  - 3 backup summary files (backup-summary-*.md)
- **Command Used:** `rm -rf /Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/factory-pulse/backups/*`
- **Result:** All backup files successfully deleted

## Files Modified
- Deleted all files in `/backups/remote/` directory

## Challenges
None encountered - deletion completed successfully.

## Results
- Backups directory is now empty and clean
- Disk space freed up
- No backup files remain in the project

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automatic backup cleanup policies
- Document backup retention strategies in project documentation
- Ensure important backups are stored in a separate location if needed for compliance

## Verification
Verified that the backups directory is now empty with no remaining files.
