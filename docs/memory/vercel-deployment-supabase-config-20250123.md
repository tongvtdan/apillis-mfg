# vercel-deployment-supabase-config-20250123 - Vercel Deployment Configuration Fix

## Context
Configured Supabase client for proper Vercel deployment with remote Supabase authentication instead of local development.

## Problem
The Supabase client was configured with local development fallbacks, causing authentication issues when deployed to Vercel production environment.

## Solution
1. Updated Supabase client to use remote Supabase URL as default for production
2. Enhanced environment variable handling to support both VITE_ and non-VITE_ prefixed variables
3. Updated production environment configuration files
4. Maintained backward compatibility for local development

## Technical Details
- Modified `src/integrations/supabase/supabase-client.ts` to use remote URL as default
- Added support for both `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL` environment variables
- Updated `env.production.example` with proper Vercel environment variable configuration
- Ensured service role client uses the same URL configuration

## Files Modified
- `src/integrations/supabase/supabase-client.ts`
- `env.production.example`

## Environment Variables for Vercel
The following environment variables need to be set in Vercel Dashboard:

**Required for Authentication:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://ynhgxwnkpbpzwbtzrzka.supabase.co`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Your Supabase anon key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = Your Supabase service role key

**Optional for Google Drive:**
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Challenges
- Need to maintain compatibility between local development and production deployment
- Ensure proper environment variable precedence (VITE_ prefixed for client-side)
- Handle both legacy and new environment variable naming conventions

## Results
- ✅ Authentication will work properly on Vercel deployment
- ✅ Maintains local development functionality
- ✅ Supports both environment variable naming conventions
- ✅ Proper fallback hierarchy for different deployment environments

## Vercel Deployment Steps
1. Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
2. Deploy the application
3. Test authentication flow on production URL
4. Verify Supabase connection logs show correct remote URL

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing environment-specific configuration files
- Add build-time validation of required environment variables
- Implement automatic environment detection for better debugging
