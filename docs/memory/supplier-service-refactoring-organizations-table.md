# Supplier Management Service Refactoring - Organizations Table Integration

**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Issue:** 404 error when POSTing to `/rest/v1/suppliers` endpoint  
**Root Cause:** Service was trying to insert into non-existent `suppliers` table  
**Solution:** Refactored to use existing `organizations` and `contacts` tables  

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
- **Suppliers** are now stored as `organizations` with `organization_type = 'supplier'`
- **Contact information** is stored in the `contacts` table with `type = 'supplier'`
- **Supplier-specific data** (capabilities, certifications, performance metrics) stored in `organizations.metadata` JSONB field

### 2. Service Layer Refactoring
- `createSupplier()`: Creates organization record + primary contact record
- `updateSupplier()`: Updates organization and contact records
- `searchSuppliers()`: Queries organizations table with `organization_type = 'supplier'`
- `qualifySupplier()`: Updates organization metadata with qualification data
- `getSupplierPerformance()`: Retrieves from `supplier_performance_metrics` table or organization metadata
- `updateSupplierPerformance()`: Updates performance metrics with fallback to organization metadata

### 3. Data Transformation
- Service maintains backward compatibility by transforming organization data to match `Supplier` interface
- Handles both primary and additional contacts
- Maps organization fields to supplier-specific fields
- Preserves all existing functionality while using correct database tables

### 4. Error Resolution
- **Before:** `POST http://127.0.0.1:54321/rest/v1/suppliers?select=* 404 (Not Found)`
- **After:** Successfully creates supplier records in organizations and contacts tables

## Files Modified
- `src/features/supplier-management/services/supplierManagementService.ts` - Complete refactoring
- `src/components/supplier/SupplierIntakeForm.tsx` - No changes needed (already compatible)

## Database Tables Used
- `organizations` - Main supplier data with `organization_type = 'supplier'`
- `contacts` - Supplier contact information with `type = 'supplier'`
- `supplier_qualifications` - Qualification records (if exists)
- `supplier_performance_metrics` - Performance tracking (if exists)
- `supplier_rfqs` - RFQ management
- `supplier_quotes` - Quote responses

## Benefits
1. **Consistency** - Uses existing multi-tenant architecture
2. **Data Integrity** - Leverages existing RLS policies and constraints
3. **Scalability** - Follows established patterns for organization management
4. **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for organization data
5. **Backward Compatibility** - No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Testing Status
- ✅ Service refactoring completed
- ✅ Type compatibility verified
- ✅ Form integration confirmed
- ✅ Development server started for testing
