# project-cleanup-202509121030 - Project Folder Cleanup and Organization

## Context
Organized debug, test, and fix files into appropriate directories within the docs/dev structure to keep the project root clean and improve file organization.

## Problem
Several debug, test, and fix files were located in the project root directory, making it cluttered and difficult to navigate. These files needed to be organized into a structured directory system as per the project guidelines.

## Solution
Moved all debug, test, and fix files from the project root to their appropriate directories within the docs/dev structure:
- Debug files → docs/dev/debug/
- Test files → docs/dev/tests/
- Fix files → docs/dev/tools/
- Setup files → docs/dev/tools/

## Technical Details
Files moved:
- Debug files: debug_document_saving.js, debug_documents_table.sql
- Test files: test_debug_utilities.js, test_document_preview.js, test_pdf_preview_fix.js, test_upload_fix.js
- Fix/setup files: fix_storage_provider.sql, setup_storage_bucket.js

Created documentation in docs/dev/README.md to record the organization policy and cleanup activities.

## Files Modified
- docs/dev/debug/debug_document_saving.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/debug/debug_documents_table.sql (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tests/test_debug_utilities.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tests/test_document_preview.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tests/test_pdf_preview_fix.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tests/test_upload_fix.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tools/fix_storage_provider.sql (moved from root)
- docs/dev/tools/setup_storage_bucket.js (moved from root)
- docs/dev/README.md (created)

## Challenges
- Ensuring no active references to these files existed in the codebase
- Maintaining consistency with the project's file organization policy
- Creating appropriate documentation for the new structure

## Results
- Project root directory is now clean and organized
- All development support files are properly categorized
- Clear documentation of the file organization policy
- Future files will follow the established structure

## Future Considerations
- Monitor adherence to the new file organization policy
- Update any documentation that may reference the old file locations
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to enforce the organization rules
