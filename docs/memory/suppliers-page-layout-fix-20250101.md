# suppliers-page-layout-fix-20250101 - SuppliersPage Layout Structure Fix

## Date & Time
January 1, 2025 - Minor HTML structure fix for SuppliersPage component

## Feature/Context
Fixed HTML structure issue in the SuppliersPage component where the Statistics Cards section had incorrect div nesting and indentation.

## Problem/Situation
- HTML structure had misplaced closing div tag
- Statistics Cards section was improperly nested outside the main container
- Indentation was inconsistent affecting code readability

## Solution/Changes
Applied minor HTML structure corrections:

1. **Removed Misplaced Div**: Removed extra closing `</div>` tag that was breaking the layout structure
2. **Fixed Nesting**: Properly nested the Statistics Cards section within the main container
3. **Corrected Indentation**: Fixed indentation for the Statistics Cards section for better code readability

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
```diff
- </div>
-
- {/* Statistics Cards */ }
- <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">

+ <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">

- **No Functional Impact**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Layout Integrity**: Statistics Cards section properly contained within page layout

## Future Considerations
- No follow-up work needed for this fix
