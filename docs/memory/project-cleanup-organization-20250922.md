# project-cleanup-organization-20250922 - Project Cleanup and Organization

## Context
Comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the Factory Pulse project to improve file structure and maintainability.

## Problem/Situation
The project root directory contained numerous development files, scripts, debug files, and temporary files that were cluttering the workspace and not following the project's organizational guidelines.

## Solution/Changes
Organized the project by moving all development-related files from the root directory to their appropriate locations in `docs/dev/` according to the project rules:

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/scripts/`:
- `backup-remote-deployment.sh`
- `backup-remote-supabase-cli.sh`
- `backup-remote-supabase.sh`
- `cleanup-old-hooks.sh`
- `deploy-vercel.sh`
- `extract_schema.sh`
- `run_seed_now.sh`
- `run-workflow-stages-migration.sh`
- `delete_draft_projects.sql` (from scripts/ directory)
- `delete_organization.md` (from scripts/ directory)
- `delete-user.sql` (from scripts/ directory)

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/debug/`:
- `check-storage-buckets.js`
- `test-remote-storage.js`
- `test-storage-upload.js`
- `test-supplier-document-upload.js`
- `debug_document_saving.js` (already existed)
- `debug_documents_table.sql` (already existed)

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/sql-scripts/`:
- `create_storage_bucket.sql`
- `fix_reviews_view.sql`
- `fix_storage_bucket_remote.sql`
- `init_default_workflow_stages.sql`
- `seed_complete_workflow_system.sql`
- `seed_from_local_backup.sql`
- `seed_workflow_stages.sql`

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/docs/`:
- `DEPLOY_COMMANDS.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `README_WORKFLOW_STAGES.md`
- `FIX_STORAGE_ISSUE_README.md`
- `AI Developer Tool Guide.md` (already existed)
- `TechStack-250904-v1.md` (already existed)
- `implement-project-tracking.md` (already existed)
- `workflow-stages-and-sub-stages-documentation.md` (already existed)
- `workflow-suppliermanagement-implement-assessments.md` (already existed)

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/temp/`:
- `index.html` (standalone development HTML file)
- `test-supplier-document.txt`

### Files Moved to `docs/dev/tools/`:
- `fix_storage_provider.sql` (already existed)
- `setup_storage_bucket.js` (already existed)

### Files/Directories Deleted:
- Empty `scripts/` directory
- Empty `database/` directory
- `dataconnect/` directory (Firebase Data Connect - unused in Supabase project)
- `bun.lockb` file (unused - project uses npm)
- All backup files (per previous request)

## Technical Details
- **Root Directory:** Now contains only essential project files (source code, config, package files)
- **Organization:** All development files properly categorized in `docs/dev/` subdirectories
- **Consistency:** Follows project rules for file organization
- **Structure:** Maintains existing `docs/dev/` folder structure while adding new subdirectories as needed

## Files Modified
- Moved 20+ files from root to appropriate `docs/dev/` subdirectories
- Removed unused directories and files
- Maintained existing project structure for core files

## Challenges
- Some files required categorization based on their purpose and content
- Ensured no breaking changes to project functionality
- Maintained proper organization while preserving file relationships

## Results
- **Clean Root Directory:** Project root now contains only essential files
- **Organized Development Files:** All development-related files properly categorized
- **Improved Maintainability:** Easier to find and manage development resources
- **Compliance:** Follows project rules for file organization

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automated file organization tools
- Regular cleanup procedures to maintain organization
- Update documentation references if needed
- Monitor for new files that should be organized

## Verification
- All development files moved to appropriate locations
- Root directory structure is clean and organized
- No functionality broken during reorganization
- Project maintains operational readiness
