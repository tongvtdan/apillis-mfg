# App Version Rollback - October 1, 2025

## Date & Time
October 1, 2025 - Version rollback from 0.2.0 to 0.1.2

## Feature/Context
Application version management in Settings page

## Problem/Situation
The application version was incorrectly set to "0.2.0" in the Settings page, but needed to be rolled back to "0.1.2" to reflect the actual current version state.

## Solution/Changes
- Rolled back APP_VERSION constant from "0.2.0" to "0.1.2" in Settings page
- Removed unused supabase import that was causing linting warnings
- Maintained all existing functionality while correcting version display

## Technical Details
### Code Changes
- **Settings.tsx**: Updated APP_VERSION constant
- **Settings.tsx**: Removed unused `import { supabase } from "@/integrations/supabase/client"`

### Version Information Display
The Settings page displays version information in the "Application Information" card:
- Application Name: "Apillis - Factory Pulse"
- Version: Now correctly shows "v0.1.2"
- Environment: Shows current build environment
- Build Status: "Production Ready"

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`

## Challenges
- None - straightforward version correction

## Results
- Settings page now correctly displays version 0.1.2
- Removed linting warning for unused import
- Version information is consistent with actual application state

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automated version management through package.json
- Establish clear versioning strategy for future releases
- Document version update process in development guidelines

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Users now see accurate version information
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated unused import warning
- **Maintenance**: Simplified import structure in Settings component
