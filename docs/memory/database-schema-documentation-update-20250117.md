# Database Schema Documentation Update - 2025-01-17

**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Purpose:** Update documentation to reflect current database schema, relationships, and RLS policies  
**Branch:** feature/new_project_manage

## Summary

Performed comprehensive analysis of the current database schema and updated documentation to reflect the actual state of the system, including new tables, functions, and RLS policies.

## Schema Analysis Results

### Current Database State
- **Total Tables:** 12 core tables + supporting tables
- **RLS Policies:** 71 active policies (from backup analysis)
- **Database Functions:** 7 custom functions
- **Enums:** 7 custom enum types

### Key Findings

#### New Tables Identified
1. **Reviews Table** - Project review and approval system
2. **Supplier Quotes Table** - Supplier quotation management
3. **Enhanced Activity Log** - Added `project_id` column for better tracking

#### Database Functions Added
1. **Security Functions:**
   - `get_current_user_org_id()` - Get current user's organization
   - `get_current_user_role()` - Get current user's role
   - `can_access_project(project_id)` - Check project access permissions
   - `is_internal_user()` - Check if user is internal
   - `is_portal_user()` - Check if user is portal user

2. **Notification Functions:**
   - `create_notification()` - Create user notifications

3. **Dashboard Functions:**
   - `get_dashboard_summary()` - Get dashboard summary data

#### RLS Policy Updates
- **Organizations Table:** Updated to allow all authenticated users to view organizations (for customer display)
- **Projects Table:** Complex access control based on user role and assignment
- **Documents Table:** Access based on project permissions
- **Activity Log:** Organization-based access control

## Documentation Updates Made

### 1. Data Schema Documentation (`docs/architecture/data-schema.md`)
- ✅ Added missing tables: Reviews, Supplier Quotes
- ✅ Updated Activity Log table with `project_id` column
- ✅ Added comprehensive Database Functions section
- ✅ Updated RLS Policies section with current policies
- ✅ Enhanced Security Model documentation

### 2. API Reference Documentation (`docs/architecture/api-reference.md`)
- ✅ Added Database Functions API section
- ✅ Added Reviews API endpoints
- ✅ Added Supplier Quotes API endpoints
- ✅ Updated Organizations API section
- ✅ Enhanced error handling examples

## Schema Relationships Verified

### Core Relationships
- **Organizations** → Users, Projects, Contacts, Workflow Stages
- **Projects** → Organizations, Users, Workflow Stages, Documents, Reviews, Supplier Quotes
- **Users** → Organizations, Projects (assigned_to, created_by)
- **Contacts** → Organizations, Supplier Quotes
- **Workflow Stages** → Organizations, Projects, Sub-Stages
- **Documents** → Organizations, Projects, Users

### Foreign Key Constraints
- All tables properly reference `organization_id` for multi-tenant isolation
- Projects properly link to customer organizations
- User assignments properly tracked
- Document versioning maintained

## Security Model Updates

### RLS Policy Summary
- **71 Active Policies** across all tables
- **Organization-based isolation** for all major tables
- **Role-based access control** for sensitive operations
- **Project-specific permissions** for documents and activities
- **User-specific restrictions** for personal data

### Authentication Integration
- Supabase Auth integration maintained
- JWT-based session management
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure password policies

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for relationships
- Composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- Partial indexes for active records
- JSONB indexes for metadata searches

### Query Optimization
- Efficient joins with proper indexing
- Use of views for complex queries
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Migration Status

### Current Migration
- `20250117000002_add_organizations_insert_policy.sql` - Latest migration
- RLS policies properly configured
- All tables have proper constraints

### Schema Consistency
- TypeScript types match database schema
- All relationships properly defined
- Enums properly configured
- Functions properly documented

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Schema Audits:** Schedule periodic schema documentation updates
2. **Migration Documentation:** Document all schema changes with migration files
3. **Function Documentation:** Keep database functions documented and tested
4. **RLS Policy Review:** Regular review of RLS policies for security compliance
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor query performance with new functions

## Files Updated

- `docs/architecture/data-schema.md` - Comprehensive schema documentation
- `docs/architecture/api-reference.md` - Updated API reference with new endpoints
- `docs/memory/database-schema-documentation-update-20250117.md` - This memory document

## Verification

All documentation updates have been verified against:
- Current database schema from `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Active RLS policies from migration files
- Database functions from schema analysis
- API usage patterns from codebase analysis

The documentation now accurately reflects the current state of the Factory Pulse database schema and provides comprehensive guidance for developers working with the system.
