## 📁 Files Modified
- `src/features/supplier-management/services/supplierManagementService.ts`
- `src/core/documents/DocumentProvider.tsx`
- `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx`
- `src/services/documentActions.ts`

- `supabase/migrations/20250117000008_document_access_security.sql`
- Added supplier document categories to enum
- Fixed RLS policies for documents table
- Implemented secure storage access policies

## 🔒 Security Model
1. **Upload**: Service role client uploads files (bypasses RLS for system operations)
2. **Storage**: Files stored in private bucket (not publicly accessible)
3. **Access**: Users can only access documents from their organization
4. **Download**: Frontend uses Supabase client for signed URLs
5. **Verification**: All access verified through database functions

## ✅ Resolution Status
- Document upload failures: RESOLVED
- Storage authentication issues: RESOLVED
- Security vulnerabilities: RESOLVED
- Cross-component compatibility: RESOLVED

## 🚀 Impact
The document management system now works seamlessly across supplier management, project management, and customer management workflows with enterprise-grade security measures in place.
