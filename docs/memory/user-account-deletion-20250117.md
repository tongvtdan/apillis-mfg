# user-account-deletion-20250117 - Test Account Cleanup

## Context
Removed orphaned test user account and associated test data from the Factory Pulse database.

## Problem
Found an orphaned user record in the users table without corresponding auth.users entry:
- User ID: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
- Name: Test User
- Role: admin
- Status: active

The user had created 3 test projects that needed to be cleaned up due to foreign key constraints.

## Solution
Executed comprehensive cleanup in proper foreign key dependency order:

1. **Deleted related records first:**
   - Activity logs (3 records)
   - Reviews (related to test projects)
   - Documents (related to test projects)
   - Messages (related to test projects)
   - Project sub-stage progress (related to test projects)

2. **Deleted test projects:**
   - Test Project 1 (inquiry status)
   - Test Project 2 (reviewing status)
   - Test Project 3 (completed status)

3. **Deleted test user account**

## Technical Details
- **Database:** Local Supabase instance
- **Tables affected:** activity_log, reviews, documents, messages, project_sub_stage_progress, projects, users
- **Foreign key handling:** Deleted child records before parent records to maintain referential integrity
- **Verification:** Confirmed all test data removed, 14 legitimate demo accounts remain

## Files Modified
- No source code files modified
- Database cleanup via direct SQL commands

## Challenges
- Foreign key constraints prevented direct user deletion
- Required systematic cleanup of related records in dependency order
- Ensured no legitimate data was accidentally removed

## Results
- ✅ Test user account completely removed
- ✅ All associated test projects deleted
- ✅ Related activity logs, reviews, documents, and messages cleaned up
- ✅ Database referential integrity maintained
- ✅ 14 legitimate demo accounts preserved

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing soft delete for user accounts to avoid orphaned records
- Add validation to prevent creation of users without auth.users entries
- Document cleanup procedures for future test data removal
