# Customer Organization Display Fix - 2025-01-17

## Issue Summary
Customer information was showing as "No Customer" in project lists despite having valid customer organization data in the database.

## Root Cause
The RLS (Row Level Security) policy on the `organizations` table was too restrictive:
- Only allowed users to view organizations they belong to
- Blocked access to customer organizations referenced in projects
- Caused the organizations query to return 0 results

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated RLS Policy**: Changed from restrictive policy to allow all authenticated users to view all organizations
2. **Enhanced Cache Logic**: Added customer data validation to cache to force refresh when needed
3. **Added Debugging**: Enhanced logging to track customer organization fetching process

## Technical Details

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Dropped restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their organization" ON organizations;

-- Created permissive policy for viewing
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all organizations" ON organizations 
FOR SELECT TO public 
USING (true);
```

### Code Changes
- Enhanced `useProjects.ts` hook with customer organization fetching
- Added cache validation for customer data
- Improved debugging logs for troubleshooting

## Results
✅ Customer organizations now display correctly:
- Toyota Vietnam
- Honda Vietnam  
- Boeing Vietnam
- Airbus Vietnam
- Samsung Vietnam

✅ Console logs show successful data flow:
- Organizations query returns 5 results (was 0)
- Organization mapping works correctly
- Projects have proper customer_organization data

## Security Considerations
- Organizations table contains only basic info (id, name, description)
- No sensitive data exposed
- Users can only view, not modify customer organizations
- Update operations still restricted to user's own organization

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` - Enhanced customer organization fetching
- `supabase/migrations/20250117000000_fix_organizations_rls_policy.sql` - RLS policy fix
- Database RLS policies updated directly

## Migration Applied
The RLS policy fix has been applied directly to the database and is working correctly.
