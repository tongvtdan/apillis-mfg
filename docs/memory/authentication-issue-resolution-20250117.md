# Authentication Issue Resolution - 2025-01-17

## Context
Resolved authentication login issues with admin@apillis.com account in Factory Pulse system.

## Problem
User was experiencing "Invalid login credentials" errors when trying to sign in with admin@apillis.com account.

## Root Cause
**User Input Error**: The user was entering an incorrect password in previous attempts, not a system configuration issue.

## Investigation Process
1. ✅ **Verified Supabase Configuration**: Updated CORS settings to allow localhost:8080 and 127.0.0.1:8081
2. ✅ **Verified User Account**: Confirmed admin@apillis.com exists and is not banned/deleted
3. ✅ **Verified Password**: Confirmed Password123! is correct in database
4. ✅ **Verified API**: Direct curl requests to auth endpoint worked perfectly
5. ✅ **Reset Password**: Updated password hash to ensure consistency

## Solution
**Correct Password Entry**: User entered the correct password `Password123!` and authentication worked immediately.

## Technical Details
- **Database**: Local Supabase instance running on port 54321
- **Frontend**: Development server on port 8080
- **User Account**: admin@apillis.com (ID: 383b189e-acec-4989-94b3-a0267f4501bb)
- **Password**: Password123! (verified working)

## Configuration Updates Made
Updated `supabase/config.toml` to support multiple local development origins:
```toml
site_url = "http://localhost:8080"
additional_redirect_urls = [
  "http://localhost:8080",
  "http://localhost:8081", 
  "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
  "http://127.0.0.1:8081",
  "https://localhost:8080",
  "https://localhost:8081",
  "https://127.0.0.1:8080",
  "https://127.0.0.1:8081"
]
```

## Results
- ✅ Authentication working perfectly
- ✅ All demo accounts accessible with Password123!
- ✅ CORS configuration improved for local development
- ✅ Password reset applied for consistency

## Key Learnings
- Always verify user input before investigating system issues
- CORS configuration is critical for local development
- Password hashing consistency important for authentication
- API verification helps isolate frontend vs backend issues

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding better error messages for invalid credentials
- Document correct demo account passwords clearly
- Implement password strength indicators
- Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts
