# Document Upload Enhancement for Inquiry Received Review Form

## Overview
Enhanced the Inquiry Received Review Form with document upload functionality and integration with the Overview Actions Required system.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Upload Buttons for Missing Documents
- **Visual Indicators**: Missing required documents are highlighted with red background and border
- **Upload Buttons**: Direct upload buttons appear next to missing required documents
- **Category-Specific Uploads**: Each upload button is context-aware for the specific document category
- **Real-time Updates**: Document completeness check updates immediately after upload

### 2. Document Completeness Enhancement
- **Missing Document Tracking**: System tracks which required documents are missing
- **Visual Feedback**: Missing documents are visually distinguished with red styling
- **Required vs Optional**: Clear distinction between required and optional documents
- **Auto-Detection**: System automatically detects document presence from database

### 3. Overview Actions Integration
- **Action Sync**: Missing documents automatically sync with Overview → Actions Required section
- **Action Creation**: Creates high-priority action items for missing required documents
- **Metadata Tracking**: Stores detailed metadata about missing documents and requirements
- **Stage Context**: Actions are tagged with current stage context

### 4. Upload Modal Integration
- **DocumentUploadZone**: Integrated existing DocumentUploadZone component
- **Category Pre-selection**: Upload modal can be pre-configured for specific document categories
- **Auto-refresh**: Document list refreshes automatically after successful uploads
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showUploadModal, setShowUploadModal] = useState(false);
const [uploadCategory, setUploadCategory] = useState<string>('');
const [missingDocuments, setMissingDocuments] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

### Document Completeness Logic
- Tracks missing required documents (RFQ, Drawings, BOM)
- Updates form state with completeness status
- Triggers action sync when missing documents change

### Action Sync Function
```typescript
const syncMissingDocumentsWithActions = async () => {
    const actionData = {
        project_id: project.id,
        action_type: 'document_upload',
        title: 'Upload Required Documents',
        description: `Missing required documents: ${missingDocuments.join(', ')}`,
        priority: 'high',
        status: 'pending',
        metadata: {
            missing_documents: missingDocuments,
            required_categories: ['rfq', 'drawing', 'bom'],
            stage: 'inquiry_received'
        }
    };
};
```

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Design
- **Color Coding**: Red styling for missing required documents
- **Button Styling**: Context-appropriate upload buttons with icons
- **Alert Messages**: Clear alerts showing missing documents and sync status
- **Responsive Layout**: Maintains responsive design across all screen sizes

### User Experience
