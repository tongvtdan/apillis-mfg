# [database-project-fixes][202509060702] - Database Schema and Project Display Fixes

## Context
Comprehensive fixes to database schema issues and project display problems in the Factory Pulse application. Multiple interconnected issues affecting project loading, customer display, and database query performance.

## Problem
Several critical issues were preventing proper functionality:
1. Projects page showing 0 active projects while dashboard worked correctly
2. All projects showing "No Customer" despite having customer data
3. Database schema ambiguity preventing proper queries
4. Project details header showing "Customer: N/A"

## Solution
Implemented multi-layered fixes addressing database schema, RLS policies, and frontend components:

### Database Fixes:
- ✅ Fixed AuthContext fallback profile organization_id fetching
- ✅ Created `projects_view` to resolve ambiguous column references
- ✅ Updated RLS policies for organization-based access control
- ✅ Fixed all customer organization references in projects

### Frontend Fixes:
- ✅ Enhanced useProjects hook with fallback logic and better error handling
- ✅ Updated all project components to use new customer organization structure
- ✅ Fixed ProjectDetailHeader to prioritize customer_organization field
- ✅ Updated search functionality to include organization names

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes:
- ✅ **ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE**: Migrated from `projects_view` to direct `projects` table usage
- Simplified RLS policies to use organization-based access instead of complex function calls
- Fixed ambiguous column references in `projects` table queries
- Updated all projects to have valid `customer_organization_id` references
- **NEW APPROACH**: Using normalized relational structure with proper ID lookups instead of denormalized view

### Frontend Component Updates:
- Updated `getCustomerDisplayName()` function to prioritize `project.customer_organization?.name`
- Enhanced `useProjects` hook with proper fallback logic
- Modified all project display components to use new organization structure
- Updated navigation and search to handle organization links

### Key Technical Improvements:
- Eliminated dual data source synchronization issues
- Improved real-time subscription handling
- Enhanced error logging and debugging capabilities
- Implemented proper organization-based access control

## Files Modified

### Database Files:
- `supabase/migrations/20250130000006_fix_rls_policy.sql` - Simplified RLS policies
- `supabase/migrations/20250130000007_create_projects_view.sql` - Created projects_view

### Frontend Files:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed fallback profile organization_id
- `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` - Added fallback logic and updated to use projects_view
- `src/components/project/ProjectDetailHeader.tsx` - Updated getCustomerDisplayName function
- `src/components/project/EnhancedProjectSummary.tsx` - Updated customer information display
- `src/components/project/EnhancedProjectList.tsx` - Updated search functionality
- `src/components/project/AnimatedProjectCard.tsx` - Updated customer navigation
- `src/components/project/actions/EditProjectAction.tsx` - Updated form fields
- `src/components/project/StageConfigurationPanel.tsx` - Updated requirement checks
- `src/components/project/EnhancedStageProgression.tsx` - Updated progress calculation

## Challenges
- Handling race conditions during database query resolution
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing data structure
- Resolving ambiguous column references in complex join queries
- Coordinating frontend component updates across multiple files
- Ensuring RLS policy changes didn't break existing functionality

## Results
- ✅ Projects page now loads correctly and shows all active projects
- ✅ Project list displays proper customer organization names (Airbus Vietnam, Samsung Vietnam, Toyota Vietnam, etc.)
- ✅ Project details header shows correct customer information instead of "N/A"
- ✅ Database queries work efficiently with proper indexing and view structure
- ✅ All customer organization references resolved correctly
- ✅ Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
- ✅ Real-time updates work reliably without synchronization issues

## Future Considerations
- Monitor database query performance with the new projects_view
- Consider implementing additional database indexes for better performance
- Review RLS policies periodically for security optimization
- Plan for future customer organization management features
- Consider implementing automated testing for database schema changes

## Related Memory Files
- This memory covers multiple interconnected fixes that were documented separately in the original MEMORY.md
- Future fixes should be documented in individual memory files following the [feature][timestamp].md format
- Database-related fixes should be tracked separately from UI/UX improvements

## Migration Notes
- Original MEMORY.md content has been migrated to this structured format
- All fixes have been verified and are working in production
- New memory files should follow this format for consistency
- Consider archiving this file monthly when the memory folder grows large
