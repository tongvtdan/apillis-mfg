## Database Mapping

**Organization Fields** → `organizations` table:

- `slug` (URL-friendly identifier)
- `description` (Company description)
- `industry` (Selected industry)
- `address`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `postal_code` (Organization address)
- `website` (Organization website)

**Contact Fields** → `contacts` table:
- `contact_name` (Primary Contact Name)
- `email` (Primary Contact Email)
- `phone` (Primary Contact Phone)
- `is_primary_contact: true` (Flags as main contact)

## User Benefits

- **No Confusion**: Clear separation between organization and contact information

- **Comprehensive Information**: All important organization fields included

## Integration

The enhanced CustomerModal is now used in both:
