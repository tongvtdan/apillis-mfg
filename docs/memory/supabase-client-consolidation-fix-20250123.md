# supabase-client-consolidation-fix-20250123 - Supabase Client Configuration Fix

## Context
Fixed authentication issues caused by hardcoded remote Supabase credentials and multiple client instances.

## Problem
The application was experiencing authentication failures with "Invalid API key" errors and "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings. The Supabase client was configured with hardcoded remote credentials instead of using environment variables for local development.

## Solution
1. Updated Supabase client configuration to use environment variables with fallback to local defaults
2. Added proper VITE_ prefixed environment variables for frontend compatibility
3. Consolidated client configuration to prevent multiple instances
4. Enhanced debug logging to only show in development mode

## Technical Details
- Modified `src/integrations/supabase/supabase-client.ts` to use `import.meta.env` variables
- Added fallback values for local development (localhost:54321)
- Updated environment files (`env.local`, `env.local.example`) with proper VITE_ prefixed variables
- Added development-only debug logging to reduce console noise
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy environment variables

## Files Modified
- `src/integrations/supabase/supabase-client.ts`
- `env.local`
- `env.local.example`

## Challenges
- Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing environment variable structure
- Ensure proper fallback behavior for different deployment environments
- Prevent multiple client instances while preserving test script functionality

## Results
- Authentication should now work with local Supabase instance
- Reduced console warnings and improved debugging experience
- Better environment variable management for different deployment scenarios

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a single Supabase client factory to prevent future multiple client issues
- Add environment validation to catch configuration issues early
- Consider adding remote Supabase configuration for production deployments
