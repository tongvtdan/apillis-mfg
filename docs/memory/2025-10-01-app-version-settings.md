# App Version Update - Settings Page

**Date & Time**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature/Context**: Application version management and settings page maintenance  
**Type**: Version Update & Code Cleanup

## Problem/Situation

The application version displayed in the Settings page needed to be updated from v0.2.0 to v0.3.0 to reflect the current development state. Additionally, there was an unused import (`supabase`) that needed to be removed to maintain clean code standards.

## Solution/Changes

### Version Update
- Updated `APP_VERSION` constant from "0.2.0" to "0.3.0" in Settings page
- This version is displayed in the Application Information section of the General tab

### Code Cleanup
- Removed unused `supabase` import from `@/integrations/supabase/client`
- The import was flagged by the linter as unused since the Settings page doesn't directly interact with Supabase

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
  - Updated version constant: `const APP_VERSION = "0.1.2";`
  - Removed unused import: `import { supabase } from "@/integrations/supabase/client";`

### Settings Page Structure
The Settings page displays:
- **General Tab**: Profile information and application details including version
- **Notifications Tab**: Placeholder for future notification preferences
- **Admin Tab**: Administrative tools (visible to management/admin roles only)

## Results

- Application version now correctly displays as v0.3.0 in the Settings page
- Removed linter warning about unused supabase import
- Maintained clean code standards without affecting functionality

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a centralized version management system
- Version information could be moved to a configuration file or environment variable
- Track version changes in a changelog for better release management

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Users can see the current application version
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated unused imports and maintained clean codebase
- **Maintenance**: Simple version updates can be made in a single location
