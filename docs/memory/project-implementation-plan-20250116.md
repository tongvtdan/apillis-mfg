## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **File Size**: Keep under 300 lines of code
- **Complexity**: Maintain cognitive complexity ‚â§ 15
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, JSDoc-documented functions
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage throughout

### Development Workflow
- **Single-threaded Focus**: Work on one feature at a time
- **Investigation First**: Research existing solutions before implementation
- **Testing**: Write tests first, then code, then validate
- **Documentation**: Update docs after significant changes

### Database Practices
- **Migration Safety**: Never reset database when working with existing data
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintain referential integrity
- **Local Development**: Work with local Supabase instance
- **Approval Required**: Always ask approval before database actions
