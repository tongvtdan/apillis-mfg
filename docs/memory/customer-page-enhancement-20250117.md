- **Added:**
  - `CustomerProjectSummary` interface with project metrics
  - `CustomerOrganizationWithSummary` interface extending Organization
  - Project status counts, total values, and averages

### 3. Enhanced Customer Table
- **File:** `src/components/customer/CustomerTableEnhanced.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Displays customer organizations instead of individual contacts
  - Shows project counts by status (active, completed, on hold, cancelled)

## Project Summary Metrics

Each customer organization now displays:

- **Active Projects:** Currently in progress
- **Completed Projects:** Successfully finished
- **Cancelled Projects:** Terminated before completion
- **On Hold Projects:** Temporarily paused

### Financial Metrics
- **Total Value:** Sum of all estimated project values
- **Active Value:** Value of currently active projects
- **Completed Value:** Value of completed projects (using actual_value when available)
- **Average Project Value:** Total value divided by project count

### Additional Information

- **Primary Contact:** Main contact person for the organization
- **Industry:** Customer's business sector
- **Location:** Geographic information

## Database Integration

### Organizations Table
