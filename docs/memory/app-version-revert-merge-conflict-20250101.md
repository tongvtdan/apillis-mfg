# App Version Revert - Merge Conflict Resolution

**Date & Time**: January 1, 2025  
**Feature/Context**: Version management and merge conflict resolution  
**Type**: Version Revert & Code Cleanup

## Problem/Situation

A merge conflict occurred in the Settings page between the main branch and the `release/fb-1.2` branch regarding the application version. The conflict involved:
- HEAD branch had version "0.2.0" 
- release/fb-1.2 branch had version "0.1.2"

The merge conflict needed to be resolved by selecting the appropriate version for the current development state.

## Solution/Changes

### Merge Conflict Resolution
- Resolved merge conflict by selecting version "0.1.2" from the release/fb-1.2 branch
- Removed Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> release/fb-1.2`)
- Maintained the APP_NAME constant as "Apillis - Factory Pulse"

### Version Decision
- Reverted from "0.2.0" back to "0.1.2" 
- This aligns with the release branch version numbering
- Indicates the application is in a stable 0.1.x release cycle

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`
  - Resolved merge conflict in APP_VERSION constant
  - Final version: `const APP_VERSION = "0.1.2";`
  - Removed Git conflict markers
  - Maintained clean code formatting

### Merge Conflict Details
```diff
-<<<<<<< HEAD
-const APP_VERSION = "0.2.0";
-const APP_NAME = "Apillis - Factory Pulse";
-=======
+const APP_VERSION = "0.1.2";
+const APP_NAME = "Apillis - Factory Pulse";
->>>>>>> release/fb-1.2
```

## Results

- Successfully resolved merge conflict without breaking functionality
- Application version now displays as v0.1.2 in Settings page
- Code is clean and ready for deployment
- Maintains consistency with release branch versioning

## Future Considerations

- **Version Management Strategy**: Consider implementing semantic versioning with automated version bumping
- **Branch Strategy**: Establish clear guidelines for version increments across branches
- **Release Process**: Document when and how version numbers should be updated
- **Configuration**: Move version information to package.json or environment variables for centralized management

## Impact

- **Development Workflow**: Clean merge resolution enables continued development
- **Version Consistency**: Aligns with release branch version numbering
- **User Experience**: Users see consistent version information in Settings
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated merge conflict markers and maintained clean codebase
