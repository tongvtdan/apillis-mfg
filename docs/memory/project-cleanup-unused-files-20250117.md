# Project Cleanup - Unused Files Removal

**Date:** 2025-01-17  
**Purpose:** Clean up unused files and directories from the project codebase  
**Branch:** feature/new_project_manage

## Summary

Performed a comprehensive cleanup of the project codebase by identifying and removing unused files, empty directories, and temporary development files.

## Files Removed

### Unused Service Files
- `src/services/projectActionService.ts` - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
- `src/services/enhancedProjectService.ts` - Not imported anywhere in the codebase  
- `src/services/projectDataService.ts` - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
- `src/services/projectActionServiceSimplified.ts` - Not imported anywhere in the codebase
- `src/services/projectServiceExtended.ts` - Not imported anywhere in the codebase

### Unused Hook Files
- `src/hooks/useProjects-clean.ts` - Clean version not being used (main useProjects.ts is active)

### Demo Files
- `src/demo/enhanced-realtime-demo.ts` - Demo file not imported anywhere
- `src/demo/` directory - Removed empty directory

### Empty SQL Files
- `add-sample-contacts.sql` - Empty file
- `debug-contacts.sql` - Empty file

### Unused Configuration Files
- `storage.rules` - Firebase storage rules (project uses Supabase)

### Empty Directories Removed
- `src/components/dev/` - Empty development components directory
- `src/utils/` - Empty utilities directory

## Analysis Method

1. **Import/Export Analysis**: Searched for all import statements to identify which files are actually being used
2. **Service Usage Check**: Verified which services are imported and used across the codebase
3. **Directory Structure Review**: Checked for empty directories and unused subdirectories
4. **File Content Analysis**: Examined files for actual usage vs placeholder content

## Impact

- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed unused service files that would have been included in builds
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Eliminated dead code and temporary files
- **Better Organization**: Removed empty directories and unused demo files
- **Maintenance**: Easier to navigate and maintain the codebase

## Files Preserved

The following files were analyzed but kept as they are actively used:
- All services that are imported and used in components/hooks
- Test files (even if not currently run, they serve as documentation)
- CSS files that are imported in main.tsx
- All active hooks and components

## Verification

All removed files were verified to not be imported or referenced anywhere in the codebase using grep searches and semantic code analysis.

## Git Status

```bash
deleted:    add-sample-contacts.sql
deleted:    debug-contacts.sql
deleted:    src/demo/enhanced-realtime-demo.ts
deleted:    src/hooks/useProjects-clean.ts
deleted:    src/services/enhancedProjectService.ts
deleted:    src/services/projectActionService.ts
deleted:    src/services/projectActionServiceSimplified.ts
deleted:    src/services/projectDataService.ts
deleted:    src/services/projectServiceExtended.ts
deleted:    storage.rules
```

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Schedule periodic codebase cleanup to prevent accumulation of unused files
2. **Import Monitoring**: Use tools to detect unused imports and exports
3. **Documentation**: Keep track of temporary files and their intended removal dates
4. **Code Review**: Include unused code detection in code review process
