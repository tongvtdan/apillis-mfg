## Overview

Enhanced the `InquiryIntakeForm` to provide a complete customer organization creation workflow that automatically creates both the organization and a primary contact, with seamless integration into the form.

## Key Improvements

- **Before:** Create Organization button did nothing
- **After:** Full workflow with database operations and form integration

### 2. **Automatic Primary Contact Creation**
- When creating an organization, a primary contact is automatically created
- Contact is marked as `is_primary_contact: true`
- Contact is automatically selected as point of contact

### 3. **Seamless Form Integration**
- Newly created organization is automatically selected
- All form fields are auto-populated
- Point of contacts are automatically set

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Loading states with spinners
- Comprehensive validation
- Success/error feedback with toast notifications
- Clear modal descriptions

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx`
- Added `isCreatingOrganization` state
- Implemented `handleCreateOrganization` function

#### `src/hooks/useCustomerOrganizations.ts`
- Updated to use `CustomerOrganizationServiceSimplified`
- Enhanced `createOrganization` to accept primary contact data

### Database Operations

```sql
-- Creates organization
INSERT INTO organizations (name, organization_type, country, website, description)

-- Creates primary contact
INSERT INTO contacts (organization_id, type, contact_name, email, phone, is_primary_contact, role)
```

## User Workflow

1. **User clicks "Create Organization"** → Modal opens
2. **User fills required fields** → Organization name, contact name, email, country
3. **User clicks "Create Organization"** → Validation runs
4. **System creates organization** → Database transaction
5. **System creates primary contact** → Linked to organization
6. **Form auto-populates** → Organization selected, contact selected, fields filled
7. **Success feedback** → Toast notification with details
8. **Modal closes** → User continues with populated form

## Validation

- **Required Fields:** Organization name, contact name, email, country
- **Email Validation:** Proper email format validation
- **Country Validation:** Must select from predefined list
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages with user-friendly feedback

## Bug Fixes

### React Hook Form Context Issue
**Issue:** `Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState' of 'useFormContext(...)' as it is null.`

**Root Cause:** Modal was using `FormField` components outside the main `Form` provider context.

**Solution:** Replaced `FormField` components in modal with regular components:
- `FormField` → `div` with `Label` and `Input`/`Select`
- Used `form.watch()` and `form.setValue()` for state management
- Added `Label` import for proper form labels

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx` (modal form fields)

## Modal Visibility Improvements

### **Issue:** Transparent background making dialog hard to see

**Root Cause:** Missing DialogOverlay and modal CSS classes

**Solution:**
- Added `DialogOverlay` with `bg-black/50` for backdrop
- Applied modal CSS classes (`modal-dialog`, `modal-dialog-header`, etc.)
- Added proper form input styling (`modal-form-input`, `modal-select-trigger`)
- Styled buttons with `modal-button-primary` and `modal-button-secondary`

### **Visual Improvements:**
- **Backdrop:** Semi-transparent dark overlay (`bg-black/50`)
- **Modal Content:** Proper shadow and border styling
- **Header:** Gradient background with amber accent border
- **Form Elements:** Consistent styling with focus states
- **Buttons:** Amber-themed primary button with hover effects
- **Max Width:** `max-w-2xl` for better layout

## Testing

- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ TypeScript validation passed
- ✅ Component integration verified
- ✅ Modal form context issue resolved
- ✅ Modal visibility and styling improved

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

## Conclusion

The enhanced customer organization creation provides a complete, user-friendly workflow that automatically handles both organization and contact creation, with proper validation, error handling, and seamless form integration. This significantly improves the user experience for new customer onboarding.
