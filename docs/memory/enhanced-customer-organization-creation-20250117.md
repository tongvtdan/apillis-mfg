## Bug Fixes

### React Hook Form Context Issue
**Issue:** `Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState' of 'useFormContext(...)' as it is null.`

**Root Cause:** Modal was using `FormField` components outside the main `Form` provider context.

**Solution:** Replaced `FormField` components in modal with regular components:
- `FormField` â†’ `div` with `Label` and `Input`/`Select`
- Used `form.watch()` and `form.setValue()` for state management
- Added `Label` import for proper form labels

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx` (modal form fields)

## Modal UI Enhancements

### **Issue:** Limited contact information and poor organization

**Solution:**
- **Reorganized Layout:** Organization info at top, contact details at bottom
- **Enhanced Contact Fields:** Added address, city, state, postal code, role, website, notes
- **Better Visual Hierarchy:** Section headers with borders and proper spacing
- **Improved Layout:** `max-w-4xl` with responsive grid and scrollable content
- **Comprehensive Data:** Saves complete organization and contact information

### **New Fields Added:**
#### **Organization Fields:**
- **Organization Address:** Street address for the organization
- **City:** Organization city
- **State/Province:** Organization state or province
- **Postal Code:** Organization postal/ZIP code

#### **Contact Fields:**
- **Role:** Purchasing, Engineering, Quality Control, Management, Sales
- **Address Information:** Street, City, State/Province, Postal Code
- **Contact Website:** Personal website or LinkedIn profile
- **Notes:** Additional contact information
- **Industry:** Organization industry classification

### **Visual Improvements:**
- **Section Headers:** Clear separation with borders and typography
- **Responsive Grid:** Works on mobile and desktop
- **Scrollable Content:** `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` for long forms
- **Better Spacing:** Improved padding and margins throughout
- **Form Validation:** Enhanced validation for all required fields

## RLS Policy Fix

### **Issue:** 403 Forbidden error when creating organizations

**Root Cause:** Missing INSERT policy for organizations table with RLS enabled

**Solution:**
- âœ… **Created Missing INSERT Policy:** `CREATE POLICY "Users can insert organizations"`
- âœ… **Database Tables:** Created organizations, contacts, and users tables
- âœ… **RLS Policies:** Added SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE policies for all tables
- âœ… **Authentication Check:** Policies verify `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`

### **Database Changes:**
- **organizations table:** Created with complete schema including address fields
- **contacts table:** Created with organization_id foreign key
- **users table:** Created for user management
- **RLS Policies:** Enabled with proper authentication checks

### **Testing Results:**
- âœ… Build compilation successful
- âœ… No linting errors
- âœ… TypeScript validation passed
- âœ… Component integration verified
- âœ… Modal form context issue resolved
- âœ… Modal visibility and styling improved
- âœ… **RLS Policy Fix Applied** - Organization creation now works
