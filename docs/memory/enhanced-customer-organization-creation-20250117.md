## Bug Fixes

### React Hook Form Context Issue
**Issue:** `Cannot destructure property 'getFieldState' of 'useFormContext(...)' as it is null.`

**Root Cause:** Modal was using `FormField` components outside the main `Form` provider context.

**Solution:** Replaced `FormField` components in modal with regular components:
- `FormField` â†’ `div` with `Label` and `Input`/`Select`
- Used `form.watch()` and `form.setValue()` for state management
- Added `Label` import for proper form labels

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx` (modal form fields)

## Modal Visibility Improvements

### **Issue:** Transparent background making dialog hard to see

**Root Cause:** Missing DialogOverlay and modal CSS classes

**Solution:**
- Added `DialogOverlay` with `bg-black/50` for backdrop
- Applied modal CSS classes (`modal-dialog`, `modal-dialog-header`, etc.)
- Added proper form input styling (`modal-form-input`, `modal-select-trigger`)
- Styled buttons with `modal-button-primary` and `modal-button-secondary`

### **Visual Improvements:**
- **Backdrop:** Semi-transparent dark overlay (`bg-black/50`)
- **Modal Content:** Proper shadow and border styling
- **Header:** Gradient background with amber accent border
- **Form Elements:** Consistent styling with focus states
- **Buttons:** Amber-themed primary button with hover effects
- **Max Width:** `max-w-2xl` for better layout

## Testing

- âœ… Build compilation successful
- âœ… No linting errors
- âœ… TypeScript validation passed
- âœ… Component integration verified
- âœ… Modal form context issue resolved
- âœ… Modal visibility and styling improved

## Future Enhancements

## Conclusion

This significantly improves the user experience for new customer onboarding.
