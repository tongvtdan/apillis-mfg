# Hook Refactoring Summary - Feature-Based Architecture

## Overview
Refactored the monolithic `useProjects.ts` hook and reorganized all hooks according to the feature-based architecture specification. This improves maintainability, separation of concerns, and follows the established architectural patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Management Feature (`src/features/project-management/hooks/`)

**Split `useProjects.ts` into focused hooks:**

- **`useProjectCreation.ts`** - Handles project creation and customer management
  - `createProject()` - Create new projects
  - `createOrGetCustomer()` - Create or retrieve customers
  - `generateProjectId()` - Generate unique project IDs

- **`useProjectListing.ts`** - Handles project fetching and real-time updates
  - `fetchProjects()` - Fetch projects with filtering
  - `refetch()` - Manual refresh
  - `subscribeToProjectUpdates()` - Real-time subscriptions
  - `clearCacheAndRefetch()` - Cache management

- **`useProjectUpdates.ts`** - Handles project modifications
  - `updateProjectStatus()` - Update project status
  - `updateProjectStage()` - Update workflow stage
  - `updateProjectStatusOptimistic()` - Optimistic updates

- **`useProjectAnalytics.ts`** - Handles project analytics and utilities
  - `getProjectById()` - Fetch individual projects
  - `getBottleneckAnalysis()` - Performance analysis
  - `ensureProjectSubscription()` - Real-time setup

- **`index.ts`** - Main aggregator hook
  - `useProjectManagement()` - Combines all project functionality
  - Re-exports individual hooks for specific use cases

### 2. Customer Management Feature (`src/features/customer-management/hooks/`)

**Moved `useCustomers.ts`:**
- Complete customer CRUD operations
- Customer search and filtering
- Organization and contact management

### 3. Supplier Management Feature (`src/features/supplier-management/hooks/`)

**Moved hooks:**
- **`useSuppliers.ts`** - Supplier CRUD operations, performance metrics, analytics
- **`useRFQs.ts`** - RFQ management and status updates

### 4. Dashboard Feature (`src/features/dashboard/hooks/`)

**Moved `useDashboardData.ts`:**
- Dashboard summary generation
- Project statistics and analytics
- Real-time data aggregation

### 5. Shared Hooks (`src/shared/hooks/`)

**Moved shared utilities:**
- **`use-toast.ts`** - Toast notification system
- **`useErrorHandling.ts`** - Error handling and retry logic

## Updated Import Statements

### Before:
```typescript
import { useProjects } from "@/hooks/useProjects";
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
import { useDashboardData } from "@/hooks/useDashboardData";
```

### After:
```typescript
import { useProjectManagement } from "@/features/project-management/hooks";
import { useToast } from "@/shared/hooks/use-toast";
import { useDashboardData } from "@/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData";
```

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each hook has a single responsibility
2. **Feature Isolation**: Hooks are organized by business domain
3. **Reusability**: Individual hooks can be imported separately
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
5. **Testing**: Smaller, focused hooks are easier to test
6. **Performance**: Components can import only what they need

## Files Updated

### Pages:
- `src/pages/Projects.tsx`
- `src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx` 
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### Components:
- All components importing the refactored hooks

## Architecture Compliance

This refactoring follows the Feature-Based Architecture Specification v1.2:
- Hooks are organized by feature domain
- Shared utilities are in dedicated shared folders
- Each feature has its own hooks directory
- Clean separation between business logic and UI components

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining components that import the old hooks
2. Add comprehensive tests for the new hook structure
3. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. Consider creating additional feature-specific hooks as needed
