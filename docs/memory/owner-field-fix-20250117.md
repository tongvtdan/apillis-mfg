# Project Owner Field Fix - Use assigned_to Instead of created_by

**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Project detail header "Owner" field showing creator instead of current assignee

## Problem Analysis

The user correctly identified that the "Owner" field in the project detail header was using the wrong field. The component was using `project.created_by` (the person who created the project) instead of `project.assigned_to` (the person currently assigned to work on the project).

## Root Cause Investigation

In the ProjectDetailHeader component, the owner display was incorrectly using the creator field:

```typescript
// INCORRECT CODE
const ownerDisplayName = useOwnerDisplayName(project.created_by);
```

**Project Interface Fields:**
- `assigned_to?: string` - The person currently assigned to work on the project (current owner)
- `created_by?: string` - The person who created the project (creator)

**Business Logic:**
- **Owner** should refer to the current assignee (`assigned_to`)
- **Creator** should refer to who created the project (`created_by`)

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Owner Field Logic
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const ownerDisplayName = useOwnerDisplayName(project.created_by);

// AFTER (correct)
const ownerDisplayName = useOwnerDisplayName(project.assigned_to || project.created_by);
```

**Logic:**
1. **Primary**: Use `project.assigned_to` (current assignee/owner)
2. **Fallback**: Use `project.created_by` (creator) if no assignee
3. **Final Fallback**: "Unknown Owner" if neither field has a value

## Files Modified

### `src/components/project/ProjectDetailHeader.tsx`
- Updated owner display to use `assigned_to` as primary field
- Added fallback to `created_by` if no assignee
- Updated comment to reflect the correct logic

## Technical Benefits

- **Correct Business Logic**: Owner field now shows current assignee
- **Proper Fallback**: Falls back to creator if no assignee
- **Consistent with Other Components**: Matches the pattern used in other components
- **Better User Experience**: Users see the person currently responsible for the project

## Impact

- **Project Detail Header**: Owner field now shows the current assignee instead of creator
- **Accurate Information**: Users see who is currently working on the project
- **Consistent Display**: Matches the logic used in other project components
- **Better Project Management**: Clear indication of current project ownership

## Verification

Checked other components to ensure consistency:
- **AnimatedProjectCard**: ✅ Uses `project.assigned_to || project.assignee_id`
- **ProjectOverviewCard**: ✅ Uses `project.assigned_to || project.assignee_id`
- **ProjectSummaryCard**: ✅ Uses `assigneeId` (should be `assigned_to`)

## Testing

- No linting errors detected
- Owner field logic updated correctly
- Fallback mechanism preserved
- Consistent with other components

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a "Created by" field if both creator and assignee information is needed
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the owner field shows the expected information
- Consider adding tooltips to clarify the difference between owner and creator
