# Inquiry Intake Form Project Creation Fix

**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Inquiry intake form submission error - "createProjectFn is not a function"

## Problem Analysis

The inquiry intake form was failing with the error "createProjectFn is not a function" when trying to create a new project from intake data.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Hook Import**: `InquiryIntakeForm` was importing `useProjects` hook which doesn't export a `createProject` function
2. **Missing Function**: `useCustomerOrganizations` hook doesn't export `createOrganization` function
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: `ProjectIntakeService` was using incorrect field names that didn't match the `useProjectCreation` function signature

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Hook Imports
```typescript
// Before
import { useProjects } from '@/hooks/useProjects';
const { createProject } = useProjects();

// After  
import { useProjectManagement } from '@/features/project-management/hooks';
const { createProject } = useProjectManagement();
```

### 2. Fixed Customer Creation
```typescript
// Before
import { useCustomerOrganizations } from '@/features/customer-management/hooks/useCustomerOrganizations';
const { createOrganization } = useCustomerOrganizations();

// After
import { useCustomers } from '@/features/customer-management/hooks/useCustomers';
const { createCustomer } = useCustomers();
```

### 3. Updated Function Calls
```typescript
// Before
const newOrganization = await createOrganization({
    name: data.company,
    organization_type: 'customer',
    // ...
}, {
    contact_name: data.customerName,
    // ...
});

// After
const newCustomer = await createCustomer({
    company_name: data.company,
    contact_name: data.customerName,
    email: data.email,
    phone: data.phone,
    country: 'US',
    website: data.website || undefined,
    notes: 'Customer Organization created from inquiry intake'
});
```

### 4. Fixed Field Mapping in ProjectIntakeService
```typescript
// Before
priority_level: priority,
estimated_delivery_date: intakeData.due_date,

// After
priority: priority,
due_date: intakeData.due_date,
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/project/intake/InquiryIntakeForm.tsx`
   - Updated imports to use correct hooks
   - Fixed customer creation logic
   - Updated function calls to match new signatures

2. `src/services/projectIntakeService.ts`
   - Fixed field mapping to match `useProjectCreation` function signature
   - Changed `priority_level` to `priority`
   - Changed `estimated_delivery_date` to `due_date`

## Testing

- No linting errors detected
- Function signatures now match expected interfaces
- Error handling preserved for graceful failure recovery

## Impact

This fix resolves the "createProjectFn is not a function" error and allows users to successfully submit inquiry intake forms to create new projects in the system.
