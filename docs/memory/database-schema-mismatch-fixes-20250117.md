# Database Schema Type Mismatches Fixed - 20250117

## Context
Identified and fixed critical mismatches between Supabase TypeScript types and current database schema that were causing issues with customer and project information retrieval.

## Problem
The application was experiencing issues with getting customer and project information after recent migrations. Analysis revealed significant mismatches between the TypeScript types and the actual database schema.

## Solution
Systematically analyzed and fixed all schema mismatches:

### 1. Projects Table Type Fixes
**Issue**: Types.ts still referenced `customer_id` but database uses `customer_organization_id` and `point_of_contacts`
**Fix**:
- Updated Row, Insert, and Update types to use `customer_organization_id` instead of `customer_id`
- Added `point_of_contacts` array field
- Updated foreign key relationships from `contacts` to `organizations` for customer_organization_id

### 2. Enum Type Corrections
**Issue**: Project priority enum mismatch - types showed "urgent" but database uses "critical"
**Fix**:
- Updated `ProjectPriority` type from `'urgent'` to `'critical'`
- Updated `PRIORITY_COLORS` mapping
- Updated `isValidProjectPriority` validation function
- Verified all other enums match database: `user_role`, `project_status`, `contact_type`, etc.

### 3. Schema Validation
**Verified**:
- Activity log table types match current schema
- Contacts table types are correct
- Database functions are properly typed
- All table relationships are accurate

## Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Updated projects table types and relationships
  - `src/types/project.ts` - Fixed priority level enum and validation

- **Database Verification**:
  - Connected to local Supabase instance
  - Queried actual enum values: `priority_level`, `user_role`, `project_status`
  - Confirmed schema matches documentation in `docs/architecture/data-schema.md`

- **Testing**:
  - Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
  - No linting errors introduced
  - Type compatibility verified

## Results
✅ **Schema mismatches resolved**
- Projects table now correctly reflects relational structure
- Enum values match database exactly
- Type safety improved across the application

✅ **Build verification passed**
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Application builds successfully
- Type checking passes

✅ **Foundation for data access fixes**
- Customer information queries should now work correctly
- Project data retrieval should function properly
- Migration from denormalized to relational approach complete

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for any remaining data access issues
- Consider regenerating types from database schema automatically
- Update any remaining legacy references to old field names
- Test customer and project retrieval functionality end-to-end
