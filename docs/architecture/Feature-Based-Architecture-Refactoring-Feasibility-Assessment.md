# 🏗️ **Factory Pulse — Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring Feasibility Assessment**

*Conducted by Feature Engineer - January 17, 2025*

---

## 📊 **Executive Summary**

**Feasibility Rating: ✅ HIGHLY FEASIBLE**

The Factory Pulse codebase is well-positioned for feature-based architecture refactoring. The current system demonstrates strong architectural foundations with clear separation of concerns, mature workflow management, and project-centric design that aligns closely with the target FB-Feature-Based Architecture Specification.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **Strong Foundation**: Project-centric design already implemented
- ✅ **Clear Separation**: Services, components, and hooks are well-organized
- ✅ **Mature Workflow**: Comprehensive workflow management system in place
- ✅ **Ready for Extraction**: Intake and review systems are self-contained
- ⚠️ **Migration Complexity**: Large codebase requires incremental approach

## 📋 **Migration Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)**

**Priority: HIGH** - Establish stable foundation

```typescript
// Target Structure
src/core/
├── auth/
│   ├── AuthProvider.tsx          // Move from contexts/
│   ├── useAuth.ts                // Move from hooks/
│   └── rls-helpers.ts            // Extract from lib/
├── workflow/
│   ├── WorkflowProvider.tsx      // New - wrap existing services
│   ├── useWorkflow.ts            // Consolidate workflow hooks
│   └── StageGateBanner.tsx       // Extract from components/
├── approvals/
│   ├── ApprovalProvider.tsx      // Move from contexts/
│   ├── useApproval.ts            // Move from hooks/
│   └── ApprovalButton.tsx        // Move from components/
└── documents/
    ├── DocumentProvider.tsx      // New - wrap existing services
    ├── useDocumentUpload.ts      // Move from hooks/
    └── DocumentUploader.tsx      // Move from components/
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Create `src/core/` directory structure
2. Move and refactor existing components/services
3. Update imports across codebase
4. Test core functionality

### **Phase 2: Feature Extraction (Week 3-4)**

**Priority: HIGH** - Extract business capabilities

```typescript
// Target Structure
src/features/
├── intake/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── IntakeForm.tsx        // Move from components/project/intake/
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useIntakeForm.ts      // Extract from existing hooks
│   └── services/
│       └── intakeService.ts      // Consolidate intake services
├── engineering-review/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── EngineeringReviewForm.tsx // Move from components/project/workflow/
│   └── services/
│       └── reviewService.ts      // Move from services/
└── costing-engine/
    ├── hooks/
    │   └── useCostSimulator.ts   // Extract cost calculation logic
    └── components/
        └── MarginSlider.tsx      // Move from components/
```

### **Phase 3: Wave Organization (Week 5-6)**

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Organize by delivery phases

```typescript
// Target Structure
src/waves/
├── wave-1/
│   ├── quotations/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── services/
│   └── items/
│       ├── components/
│       └── services/
├── wave-2/
│   ├── engineering/
│   └── planning/
└── wave-3/
    ├── procurement/
    ├── quality/
    └── shipping/
```

## ⚠️ **Risk Assessment**

### **High Risk Areas**

1. **Import Dependencies** 🔴
   - **Risk**: Breaking circular dependencies during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Use dependency mapping tool, migrate in dependency order

2. **Database Schema** 🟡
   - **Risk**: RLS policies may need updates
   - **Mitigation**: Test RLS after each migration phase

3. **Context Providers** 🟡
   - **Risk**: Multiple context providers may conflict
   - **Mitigation**: Consolidate providers, use composition pattern

### **Medium Risk Areas**

1. **Type Definitions** 🟡
   - **Risk**: Type imports may break during refactoring
   - **Mitigation**: Create shared types layer first

2. **Testing** 🟡
   - **Risk**: Existing tests may break
   - **Mitigation**: Update tests incrementally
