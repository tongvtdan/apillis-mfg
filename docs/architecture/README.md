## Key Architecture Components

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **State Management**: React Query, Context API, Custom Hooks
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion

### Core Architectural Patterns
- **Component Composition**: Reusable, composable UI components
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic encapsulation and reuse
- **Service Layer**: API abstraction and data transformation
- **Context Providers**: Global state management
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization

## Database Schema

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Factory Pulse uses organization-based multi-tenancy with complete data isolation:
- Each organization has isolated users, projects, and workflows
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures data privacy
- Shared infrastructure with logical separation

### Core Entities
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant isolation
- **Users**: Authentication and role management
- **Projects**: Core business entity with dynamic workflows
- **Contacts**: Customers, suppliers, and partners
- **Workflow Stages**: Configurable business processes
- **Documents**: File management with version control
- **Activity Log**: Comprehensive audit trail

## System Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- React components with TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible UI with Radix components
- Real-time updates and notifications

### 2. Application Layer
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Service classes for API interactions
- Context providers for state management
- Error handling and validation

### 3. Data Access Layer
- Supabase client for database operations
- Real-time subscriptions
- File storage and management
- Authentication and authorization

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- PostgreSQL database with RLS
- Supabase Auth for user management
- Supabase Storage for file handling
- Supabase Realtime for live updates

## Security Model

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure password policies
- Session management

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Organization-based data isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- API-level permission checks

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Secure file upload handling

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimizations
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Lazy loading of components
- React Query for efficient caching
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Backend Optimizations
- Database indexing strategy
- Query optimization and pagination
- Real-time subscription filtering
- CDN for static assets

### Caching Strategy
- Multi-layer caching (React Query, browser, CDN)
- Background refetching for data freshness
- Cache invalidation on data changes
- Offline support capabilities

## Development Workflow

### Component Development
1. Create component with TypeScript interfaces
2. Implement business logic in custom hooks
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Write unit tests and integration tests
5. Document component usage and props

### API Integration
1. Define TypeScript interfaces for API responses
2. Create service methods for data operations
3. Implement error handling and retry logic
4. Add real-time subscriptions where needed
5. Write API integration tests

### Database Changes
1. Design schema changes with backward compatibility
2. Create migration scripts
3. Update TypeScript types
4. Test with existing data
5. Update documentation

## Deployment Architecture
