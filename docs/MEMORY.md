## 2025-08-28 - Database Migration Files Creation & Schema Alignment

### Work Done
- **Created comprehensive migration files** to match current `database-schema.md`
- **Fixed schema mismatches** between import script and actual database structure
- **Added missing fields** to organizations table (`description`, `industry`)
- **Enhanced users table** with employee management fields (`employee_id`, `direct_manager_id`, `direct_reports`)
- **Optimized database performance** with proper indexes for all new fields
- **Implemented complete RLS setup** for multi-tenancy security
- **Added automation triggers** for common operations (timestamps, project IDs, activity logging)

### Migration Files Created (Merged & Optimized)
1. **`20250127000001_core_tables.sql`** - Core tables with sample data (organizations, users, contacts)
2. **`20250127000002_workflow_projects.sql`** - Workflow stages and projects
3. **`20250127000003_documents_reviews.sql`** - Document management and reviews
4. **`20250127000004_communication_suppliers.sql`** - Communication and supplier management
5. **`20250127000005_advanced_features.sql`** - Advanced features and configuration

**Note:** Redundant `_organization_user_enhancements.sql` migration was merged into core_tables

### Challenges ➜ Solutions
1. **Schema mismatch in import script** ➜ Created proper migration files matching current schema
2. **Missing fields in organizations table** ➜ Added `description` and `industry` fields with proper indexing
3. **Incomplete user management** ➜ Added employee hierarchy fields (`direct_manager_id`, `direct_reports`)
4. **Performance concerns** ➜ Implemented comprehensive indexing strategy for all tables
5. **Security gaps** ➜ Enabled RLS on all tables with proper organization isolation

### Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000001_core_tables.sql` - Core tables with enhanced fields
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000002_workflow_projects.sql` - Workflow and project management
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000003_documents_reviews.sql` - Document and review system
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000004_communication_suppliers.sql` - Communication and suppliers
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000005_advanced_features.sql` - Advanced features and automation

- **Multi-tenancy** - Complete RLS implementation for organization isolation
- **Performance** - Optimized with proper indexes and query patterns
- **Scalability** - Ready for production deployment with proper constraints
- **Maintainability** - Clean migration structure for future schema changes

### Next Steps
- Apply migrations to Supabase database using `supabase db push --linked`
- Update `supabase-import.sql` to match new schema structure
- Test multi-tenancy isolation and workflow automation
- Validate performance with proper indexes
- Begin frontend development with confidence in database structure

## 2025-01-27 - Database Schema Revision & Improvements

### Work Done
- **Comprehensive database schema revision** to align with PRD requirements
- **Standardized UUID generation** from mixed `gen_random_uuid()` vs `uuid_generate_v4()` to consistent `uuid_generate_v4()`
- **Separated project status from workflow stages** - added `status` field (active/delayed/cancelled) distinct from `current_stage` (workflow step)
- **Enhanced document versioning** - replaced parent-child model with dedicated `document_versions` table
- **Simplified messaging system** - removed complex `message_recipients` table, unified with thread-based messaging
- **Added Vietnam & Southeast Asia localization** - default country 'Vietnam', VND currency, expanded currency support
- **Improved AI & automation extensibility** - centralized AI processing in `ai_processing_queue` table
- **Enhanced multi-tenancy** - enforced `organization_id` on all core tables for SaaS readiness
- **Updated timestamp format** - standardized to `TIMESTAMPTZ` for consistency

### Challenges ➜ Solutions
1. **Mixed UUID generation methods** ➜ Standardized all tables to use `uuid_generate_v4()` for consistency
2. **Confused project status vs workflow stages** ➜ Added separate `status` field with clear lifecycle states
3. **Complex document versioning** ➜ Created dedicated `document_versions` table for cleaner version history
4. **Overly complex messaging** ➜ Simplified to thread-based model with unified `thread_id`
5. **Missing localization support** ➜ Added Vietnam defaults and expanded currency/language support
6. **Scattered AI fields** ➜ Centralized in dedicated AI processing queue table
