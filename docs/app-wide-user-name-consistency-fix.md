# App-Wide User Name Display Consistency Fix

## Issue Identified
The application had inconsistent user name display across different components, with some showing user IDs instead of names due to mixed hook usage patterns.

## Problem Details
- **Inconsistent Hook Usage**: Some components used `useUsers` (batch loading), others used `useUserDisplayName` (individual loading)
- **Timing Issues**: `useUsers` hook had dependency and timing problems with user data loading
- **Mixed Fallbacks**: Different components handled loading states differently
- **User ID Display**: Some components showed UUIDs instead of readable names

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Mixed Architecture**: No standardized approach for user name display
2. **Hook Limitations**: `useUsers` with Map approach was less reliable than individual user fetching
3. **Dependency Issues**: `useUsers` hook had complex dependency management
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Different components used different approaches for the same functionality

## Solution Implemented
**Standardized on `useUserDisplayName` hook across the entire application**

### Components Updated:

1. **EnhancedProjectList.tsx**:
   - Removed `useUsers` hook usage
   - Added `AssigneeDisplay` component using `useUserDisplayName`
   - Updated filter dropdown to use individual user lookups

2. **ProjectDetail.tsx**:
   - Removed `useUsers` hook for reviewer users
   - Simplified component with individual user lookups

3. **ReviewList.tsx**:
   - Removed `useUsers` hook for reviewer users
   - Added `ReviewerDisplay` component using `useUserDisplayName`

4. **ReviewStatusPanel.tsx**:
   - Removed `useUsers` hook for reviewer users
   - Added `AssignedReviewerDisplay` component using `useUserDisplayName`

### Reusable Components Created:
- **`AssigneeDisplay`**: For project assignees
- **`UserDisplayName`**: For general user names
- **`ReviewerDisplay`**: For review assignees
- **`AssignedReviewerDisplay`**: For assigned reviewers

## Technical Benefits
- **Consistent Architecture**: Single pattern for user name display
- **Reliable Loading**: Individual user fetching is more reliable
- **Better Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient caching
- **Simplified Dependencies**: No complex dependency arrays
- **Reusable Components**: Consistent patterns across the app

## Verification Results
- ✅ **Project Lists**: Both card and table views show user names correctly
- ✅ **Project Details**: Assignee and reviewer names display properly
- ✅ **Review Components**: All reviewer names display consistently
- ✅ **Filter Dropdowns**: User names in filters display correctly
- ✅ **Loading States**: Proper fallback behavior across all components

## Current State
- **Consistent UI**: All user names display consistently across the app
- **Reliable Loading**: No more user ID displays due to loading issues
- **Better Performance**: Individual user fetching is more efficient
- **Maintainable Code**: Single pattern for user name display
- **Reusable Components**: Consistent components across the app

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. **User Experience**: All user names display correctly and consistently
2. **Developer Experience**: Single, reliable pattern for user name display
3. **Performance**: More efficient user data loading
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend user display functionality
