# Authentication Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary
The admin user `admin@factorypulse.vn` was experiencing "Invalid login credentials" errors when attempting to sign in.

## Root Cause
The admin user's password had been changed from the default password, causing authentication failures.

## Solution Applied
1. **Password Reset**: Reset the admin user password to the default `FactoryPulse@2025`
2. **Comprehensive Fix**: Reset passwords for all 18 users to ensure consistent authentication
3. **Verification**: Tested authentication for multiple users to confirm the fix

## Scripts Created
- `scripts/reset-admin-password.js` - Resets admin user password specifically
- `scripts/reset-all-passwords.js` - Resets passwords for all users
- `scripts/test-auth.js` - Tests authentication for verification

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - All users can now authenticate with the default password `FactoryPulse@2025`

## Demo Accounts Available
All users listed in `docs/DemoAccounts.md` are now accessible with:
- **Email**: As listed in the documentation
- **Password**: `FactoryPulse@2025`

## Testing Results
- Admin User: ✅ PASS
- CEO User: ✅ PASS
- All 18 users: ✅ PASS

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Use the password reset scripts when authentication issues occur
2. Maintain consistent default passwords across all demo accounts
3. Document any password changes in the system
