### Test Coverage
- Component rendering tests
- Modal open/close functionality
- Props validation
- Error handling scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Bulk Approval Workflow
1. User navigates to Approvals page
2. Clicks "Select Multiple" to enter bulk mode
3. Selects desired approvals using checkboxes

- Progress indicators for bulk operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Delegation Rules**
   - Role-based auto-delegation
   - Escalation policies
   - Approval routing

2. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Delegation usage metrics
   - Approval processing times
   - Bottleneck identification

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Native mobile app integration
   - Push notifications
   - Offline approval capabilities
