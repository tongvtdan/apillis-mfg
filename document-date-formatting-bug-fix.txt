fix: Resolve date formatting error in document management views

- Fix "Invalid time value" error when switching from grid to list view
- Resolve field name inconsistency: DocumentList was using `uploaded_at` instead of `created_at`
- Add safe date formatting utility to prevent future date-related errors
- Update all document components to use consistent and safe date formatting

**Root Cause:**
- DocumentList component was referencing non-existent `uploaded_at` field
- Direct use of `new Date()` without null/undefined validation
- Inconsistent field usage between DocumentList and DocumentGrid components

**Technical Fixes:**
- Correct field name from `document.uploaded_at` to `document.created_at`
- Add `formatDate()` utility function with comprehensive error handling
- Implement null/undefined checks before date formatting
- Add try-catch error handling for invalid date strings

**Components Updated:**
- DocumentList: Fixed field name and added safe date formatting
- DocumentGrid: Added safe date formatting
- DocumentPreview: Added safe date formatting
- DocumentActionsService: Added formatDate utility function

**User Experience:**
- No more crashes when switching between document views
- Consistent date display across all document components
- Graceful handling of invalid dates with fallback messages
- Better error logging for debugging

Files changed:
- src/services/documentActions.ts (updated)
- src/components/project/DocumentList.tsx (updated)
- src/components/project/DocumentGrid.tsx (updated)
- src/components/project/DocumentPreview.tsx (updated)
- MEMORY.md (updated)

This fix ensures robust date handling throughout the document management
system and prevents similar errors in the future.
