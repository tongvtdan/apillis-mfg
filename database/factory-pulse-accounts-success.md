## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Changes Made
- ✅ Added new columns to existing `users` table for Factory Pulse data
- ✅ Created Factory Plus Manufacturing organization
- ✅ Added all 16 user accounts with complete profile information
- ✅ Set up proper organizational relationships and reporting structure
- ✅ Created database indexes for performance optimization

### Scripts Used
1. **`factory-pulse-accounts-compatible.sql`** - Main creation script (compatible with existing schema)
2. **Manual fixes** - Added the 2 accounts that had field length issues

### Supabase CLI Commands Used
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status

# Run the account creation script
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -f database/factory-pulse-accounts-compatible.sql

# Verify account creation
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%factoryplus.com%'"
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Authentication Setup
The accounts are created in the `users` table but **do not have Supabase Auth credentials yet**. To enable login:

1. **Option A: Manual Auth Setup**
   - Use Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
   - Create auth users for each email with passwords from `login-credentials-summary.md`

2. **Option B: Programmatic Auth Setup**
   - Use Supabase Admin API to create auth users
   - Link them to existing user profiles via organization_id

### For Application Integration
- Users table now contains all Factory Pulse organizational data
- Use `organization_id` to link users to Factory Plus Manufacturing
- Implement role-based access control using `system_access_level` and `permissions` fields
- Set up department-based filtering using `department` field

## 📊 Database Structure

### Key Fields Added
- `employee_id` - Unique employee identifier
- `phone`, `extension` - Contact information
- `position`, `department` - Organizational structure
- `direct_manager`, `direct_reports` - Reporting relationships
- `permissions` - Array of specific permissions
- `system_access_level` - Role-based access level
- `security_clearance` - Security level (Level 1-5)
- `account_type` - internal/supplier/customer
- `company`, `company_address` - External partner info
- `supplier_id`, `customer_id` - Partner identifiers

## 🔐 Security Notes

- All accounts are marked as `is_active = true`
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on the users table
- Users are linked to Factory Plus Manufacturing organization
- External partners have limited access based on account type

## ✅ Success Verification

Run this query to verify all accounts:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_accounts,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE account_type = 'internal') as internal_accounts,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE account_type = 'supplier') as supplier_accounts,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE account_type = 'customer') as customer_accounts
FROM public.users
WHERE email LIKE '%@factoryplus.com' OR email LIKE '%@viettech.com.vn' OR email LIKE '%@autotech.com';
```

**Expected Result:** 16 total (12 internal, 2 supplier, 2 customer)
