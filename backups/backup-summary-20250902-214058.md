## Backup Warnings

The backup process generated warnings about circular foreign-key constraints in the following tables:
- **messages** - Circular references in message threading
- **users** - Circular references in user relationships
- **approvals** - Circular references in approval workflows

These warnings are expected and do not affect backup integrity. The circular constraints are part of the application's design for maintaining referential integrity.

## Restore Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Local Supabase instance running
- PostgreSQL client (psql) available
- Backup files accessible

### Schema-Only Restore
```bash
# Reset database and restore schema

```

### Complete Restore (Recommended)
```bash
# Reset database and restore complete backup
supabase db reset --local
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres < backups/factory_pulse_complete_backup_20250902_214058.sql
```

### Data-Only Restore (Advanced)
```bash
# Restore data to existing schema (requires --disable-triggers)
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres --disable-triggers < backups/factory_pulse_data_backup_20250902_214058.sql
