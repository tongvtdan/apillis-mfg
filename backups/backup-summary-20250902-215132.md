## Recent Database Changes Captured

### Intake Type Architecture Implementation
This backup captures the recent implementation of intake type architecture that separates intake classification from project type classification:

#### New Database Fields Added:
- **`intake_type`** (enum): Classifies the type of intake submission
  - Values: 'rfq', 'purchase_order', 'project_idea', 'direct_request'
  - Default: NULL
  - Purpose: Distinguishes between different types of project submissions

- **`intake_source`** (varchar): Tracks the source of the intake
  - Default: 'portal'
  - Purpose: Identifies where the project request originated

#### Database Schema Updates:
- **Enum Type**: `intake_type` enum created with four intake classification values
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes added for `intake_type` and `intake_source`
- **Column Comments**: Documentation added for new fields
- **Migration**: `20250902150000_add_intake_type_to_projects.sql` applied

#### Intake Type Mappings:
- **RFQ** → fabrication projects (inquiry_received stage)
- **Purchase Order** → manufacturing projects (order_confirmed stage)  
- **Project Idea** → system_build projects (technical_review stage)
- **Direct Request** → flexible routing based on content

## Database Contents Overview

### Core Tables
- **organizations** - Organization management
- **users** - User accounts and profiles
- **projects** - Project management with intake type classification
- **workflow_stages** - Workflow stage definitions
- **workflow_sub_stages** - Workflow sub-stage configurations
- **contacts** - Contact management (customers, suppliers)
- **documents** - Document storage and management
- **reviews** - Review and approval system
- **messages** - Communication system
- **notifications** - Notification management
- **activity_log** - Activity tracking and audit trail

### Manufacturing-Specific Tables
- **purchase_orders** - Purchase order management
- **production_orders** - Production order tracking
- **inventory_items** - Inventory management
- **supplier_rfqs** - Supplier RFQ management
- **approvals** - Approval workflow system

### Storage Integration
- **storage.buckets** - Document storage buckets
- **storage.objects** - File storage objects
- **storage.policies** - Storage access policies

## Backup Warnings

The backup process generated warnings about circular foreign-key constraints in the following tables:
- **messages** - Circular references in message threading
- **users** - Circular references in user relationships
- **approvals** - Circular references in approval workflows

These warnings are expected and do not affect backup integrity. The circular constraints are part of the application's design for maintaining referential integrity.

## Restore Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Local Supabase instance running
- PostgreSQL client (psql) available
- Backup files accessible

### Schema-Only Restore
```bash
# Reset database and restore schema
supabase db reset --local
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres < backups/factory_pulse_schema_backup_20250902_215132.sql
```

### Complete Restore (Recommended)
```bash
# Reset database and restore complete backup
supabase db reset --local
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres < backups/factory_pulse_complete_backup_20250902_215132.sql
```

### Data-Only Restore (Advanced)
```bash
# Restore data to existing schema (requires --disable-triggers)
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres --disable-triggers < backups/factory_pulse_data_backup_20250902_215132.sql
```

## Intake Type System Details

### Intake Classification
The new intake type system provides intelligent routing of different project submissions:

1. **RFQ (Request for Quote)**:
   - Maps to 'fabrication' project type
   - Starts in 'inquiry_received' workflow stage
   - Medium priority assignment
   - Typical for new customer inquiries

2. **Purchase Order**:
   - Maps to 'manufacturing' project type
   - Starts in 'order_confirmed' workflow stage
   - High priority assignment
   - For confirmed orders ready for production

3. **Project Idea**:
   - Maps to 'system_build' project type
   - Starts in 'technical_review' workflow stage
   - Low priority assignment
   - For conceptual projects requiring technical evaluation

4. **Direct Request**:
   - Flexible routing based on project content
   - Determines project type from description analysis
   - Variable priority assignment
   - For miscellaneous project requests

### Technical Implementation
- **Intake Mapping Service**: Routes intake types to appropriate project types and stages
- **Workflow Service**: Determines initial stage based on intake classification
- **Project Intake Service**: Unified service for creating projects from intake data
- **Simplified Form**: Cleaner user interface without file upload complexity

## Next Steps

1. **Test Restoration:** Verify backup integrity by testing restore process
2. **Intake System Testing:** Test intake type classification and routing
3. **Documentation Update:** Update system documentation with intake type architecture
4. **Monitoring:** Set up regular backup monitoring
5. **Automation:** Consider automated backup scheduling
