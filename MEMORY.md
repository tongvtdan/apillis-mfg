export const ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES = {
    // ... other roles
    management: '/admin/dashboard',  // Non-existent route
    admin: '/admin/dashboard',       // Non-existent route
} as const;

// After
export const ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES = {
    // ... other roles  
    management: '/dashboard',        // Existing route
    admin: '/dashboard',             // Existing route

filename, original_file_name, document_type, storage_path, uploaded_at

// After
file_name, title, category, file_path, created_at
```

3. **Storage Bucket Fix**:
```typescript
// Before
.from('project-documents')

// After
.from('documents')
```

4. **Interface Updates**:
```typescript
// Updated ProjectDocument interface to match actual database schema
export interface ProjectDocument {
  id: string;
  project_id: string;
  file_name: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  file_size?: number;

**Issue Identified:**
- Side menu items were showing loading screen for 200-300ms when clicked
- Artificial delays in `useProjectNavigation` hook (300ms) and `InteractiveNavigationSidebar` component (200ms)
- Loading screen appeared even though data was already loaded by hooks

**Root Cause:**
- `handleTabChange` function in `useProjectNavigation` hook had artificial delay: `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300))`
- `handleTabClick` function in `InteractiveNavigationSidebar` had artificial delay: `setTimeout(() => {...}, 200)`
- These delays were intended to simulate async loading but caused unnecessary loading screens

**Solution Implemented:**

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useProjectNavigation.ts` - Removed 300ms artificial delay from `handleTabChange`
- `src/components/project/InteractiveNavigationSidebar.tsx` - Removed 200ms artificial delay from `handleTabClick`

**Technical Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Artificial delay causing loading screen
const handleTabChange = async (tabId: string) => {
    setNavigationState(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        tabLoadingStates: { ...prev.tabLoadingStates, [tabId]: true }
    }));
    
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300)); // Artificial delay
    
    setNavigationState(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        activeTab: tabId,
        tabLoadingStates: { ...prev.tabLoadingStates, [tabId]: false }
    }));
};

// After: Immediate tab switching
const handleTabChange = async (tabId: string) => {
    setNavigationState(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        activeTab: tabId,
        tabLoadingStates: { ...prev.tabLoadingStates, [tabId]: false }
    }));
    return true;
};
```

**Benefits:**
- **Immediate Response**: Tab switching is now instant without artificial delays

### 2025-09-01 - Project Detail Page Error Fixes

**Issues Identified and Fixed:**

1. **Variable Reference Error in Projects.tsx:**
   - **Problem**: `allProjectProgress` variable was being used before it was defined in the `getSubStageProgress` function
   - **Solution**: Modified the function signature to accept `allProjectProgress` as a parameter and updated all calls to pass the parameter
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/Projects.tsx`

2. **Layout Conflict in ProjectDetail.tsx:**
   - **Problem**: ProjectDetail component was wrapped in AppLayout but also trying to create its own full-screen layout with ResponsiveNavigationWrapper, causing layout conflicts
   - **Solution**: Removed AppLayout wrapper from the ProjectDetail route in App.tsx to allow the component to use its own navigation layout
   - **Files Modified**: `src/App.tsx`

3. **Potential Null Reference Error:**
   - **Problem**: ResponsiveNavigationWrapper was being rendered with `project.id` and `project.title` even when project might be null
   - **Solution**: Added conditional rendering guard `{project && (...)}` around ResponsiveNavigationWrapper
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`

4. **useProjectNavigation Hook Parameter:**
   - **Problem**: Hook was being called with empty string when `id` was undefined, potentially causing session storage issues
   - **Solution**: Changed `projectId: id || ''` to `projectId: id || 'temp'` to provide a valid fallback
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`

5. **Variable Reference Error in ProjectDetail.tsx:**
   - **Problem**: `documents`, `messages`, and `supplierRfqs` variables were being used in the `useProjectNavigation` hook before they were defined, causing a temporal dead zone error
   - **Solution**: Moved the data fetching hooks (`useDocuments`, `useProjectMessages`, `useSupplierRfqs`, `useProjectReviews`) before the `useProjectNavigation` hook call
   - **Files Modified**: `src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- **Projects.tsx Fix**: Updated `getSubStageProgress` function signature and all calling locations

### 2025-08-31 - RLS Policy Fixes and Circular Dependency Resolution

**Task Completed:**
- Fixed critical RLS policy issues preventing user profile fetching
- Resolved circular dependency in users table RLS policies
- Fixed type casting error in reviews table RLS policies
- Updated RLS policy documentation to reflect current state

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Circular Dependency**: Users table had policy "Users can view users in their org" that queried the users table within RLS, creating infinite loops
2. **Type Casting Error**: Reviews table policies had incorrect type casting with user_role enum arrays
3. **User Profile Fetching**: Users couldn't fetch their own profiles due to RLS evaluation failures

**Solutions Implemented:**

**1. Circular Dependency Fix:**
- **Problem**: Policy `(organization_id IN (SELECT users_1.organization_id FROM users users_1 WHERE (users_1.id = auth.uid())))` created circular dependency
- **Solution**: Removed problematic policy and kept essential policies:
  - `"Users can view their own profile"` - `(id = auth.uid())`
  - `"Users can view other users in their org"` - Role-based access using helper functions
  - `"Users can update their own profile"` - `(id = auth.uid())`
  - `"Users can create profiles"` - Admin/management only

**2. Reviews Policy Type Casting Fix:**
- **Problem**: `get_current_user_role()::user_role = ANY(SELECT responsible_roles FROM workflow_stages...)` caused type casting error
- **Solution**: Used EXISTS clause instead of direct ANY comparison:
  ```sql
  EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM workflow_stages 
      WHERE id = (SELECT current_stage_id FROM projects WHERE id = reviews.project_id)
      AND get_current_user_role()::user_role = ANY(responsible_roles)
  )
  ```

**3. Helper Functions Verification:**
- **Confirmed**: All helper functions are properly implemented:
  - `get_current_user_org_id()` - Returns organization ID
  - `get_current_user_role()` - Returns user role as TEXT
  - `is_internal_user()` - Checks if user has internal role
  - `is_portal_user()` - Checks if user has portal role
  - `can_access_project(UUID)` - Comprehensive project access check

```typescript
// Before: Wrong column name
current_stage:workflow_stages!current_stage_id(
  id,
  name,
  description,
  order_index,  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
  is_active
)

// After: Correct column name
current_stage:workflow_stages!current_stage_id(
  id,
  name,
  description,
  stage_order,  // ✅ Correct column name
  is_active
)

// Before: Wrong type definition
interface WorkflowStage {
  order_index: number;  // ❌ Wrong field name
}

// After: Correct type definition
interface WorkflowStage {
  stage_order: number;  // ✅ Correct field name
  order_index?: number;  // ✅ Computed for backward compatibility
}

.from('customers')

// After: Querying correct table with filter
.from('contacts')
.eq('type', 'customer')

// Before: Wrong field names
interface CreateCustomerRequest {
  name: string;
  company?: string;
}

// After: Correct field names
interface CreateCustomerRequest {
  company_name: string;
  contact_name?: string;

  - **Robust Error Handling**: Prevents activity logging failures from blocking database operations

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Enhanced `log_activity()` Function**: 
  - Added `entity_org_id` variable for better organization ID resolution
  - Implemented fallback chain: `NEW.organization_id → OLD.organization_id → user_org_id`
  - Added conditional check `IF entity_org_id IS NOT NULL` before logging
  - Maintains audit trail integrity while preventing logging failures

- **Organization ID Resolution Logic**:
  ```sql
  -- Get entity's organization ID (fallback to user's org if not found)
  entity_org_id := COALESCE(NEW.organization_id, OLD.organization_id, user_org_id);
  
  -- Only log if we have an organization ID
  IF entity_org_id IS NOT NULL THEN
      -- Insert activity log entry
  END IF;
  ```

- **Multi-Tenant Audit Trail**: Ensures all activity log entries have proper organization association
- **Graceful Degradation**: Database operations continue even if activity logging encounters issues
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Activity logging triggers remain active on projects, contacts, and reviews tables

**Impact:**
- ✅ **Improved Reliability**: Activity logging no longer fails due to missing organization context
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Safety**: All activity log entries properly associated with organizations
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Database operations protected from logging-related failures
- ✅ **Audit Trail Integrity**: Maintains comprehensive activity tracking while improving robustness
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Enhanced error handling suitable for production deployment

**Database Functions Status**: Enhanced and production-ready with robust error handling
**Ready for**: Production deployment, comprehensive audit trail, multi-tenant activity logging

- Import sample organizations and workflow stages
- Create authentication users and test multi-tenant access
- Implement remaining business logic tables for complete system

## Architecture Notes

### Type System Evolution
The project has completed transition from a legacy enum-based stage system to a dynamic database-driven workflow system:

- **Legacy System**: `ProjectStage` enum with hardcoded stages (maintained for backward compatibility)
- **Current System**: `WorkflowStage` interface aligned with database schema
- **Database-Driven**: Workflow stages are now configurable via `workflow_stages` table
- **Status vs Stage**: `ProjectStatus` refers to project lifecycle (active/completed), while stages refer to workflow position
- **Schema Alignment**: Interface fields now match database columns exactly (`slug`, `stage_order`, `color`, etc.)
- **Computed Fields**: Legacy fields like `order_index` are computed from database fields for compatibility

### Component Architecture
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with `ProjectErrorBoundary`
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, then syncs with database
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions for live data
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching system for performance optimization
- **Table Views**: Simplified HTML tables for better performance and maintainability
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Automatic field mapping for backward compatibility with existing components
- **Dynamic Workflow Stages**: Components now use database-driven workflow stages via `workflowStageService`
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes for better separation of concerns

## Development Guidelines

### Type Safety
- Always import the correct types for the context
- Use `ProjectStatus` for project lifecycle status ('active', 'completed', etc.)
- Use `ProjectStage` for legacy workflow stages (backward compatibility only)
- Use `WorkflowStage` for current database-driven workflow stages
- Use string IDs for workflow stage references (not enum values)
- Ensure interface fields match database schema exactly for new features
- Use computed fields (`order_index`) for legacy compatibility when needed
- Prefer `workflowStageService` methods over direct database queries for stage operations

### Error Handling
- Wrap components in appropriate error boundaries
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Provide fallback mechanisms for offline/error states

### Performance
- Leverage caching for frequently accessed data
- Use selective subscriptions for real-time updates
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- Prefer simple HTML tables over complex components for basic data display

### Data Compatibility
- Use automatic field mapping in data hooks for legacy component support
- Map database field names to expected component field names during data transformation
- Maintain both new database-aligned fields and legacy compatibility fields
- Ensure computed fields (like `order_index`) are available for existing sorting logic
