   - **Objective**: Fix incorrect organization assignments where customers and suppliers were all assigned to Factory Pulse Vietnam organization instead of having their own separate organizations
   - **Issues identified**: All 20 contacts (8 customers, 12 suppliers) were incorrectly assigned to `organization_id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"` (Factory Pulse Vietnam)
   - **Root cause**: Data structure treated external companies as contacts within Factory Pulse's organization, which doesn't make business sense for external business relationships
   - **Solution implemented**: 
     - Created 25 separate organizations for major customers and suppliers
     - Updated all customer contacts to reference their respective organizations
     - Updated all supplier contacts to reference their respective organizations

     - `estimated_value` - Used extensively for project budgeting and financial calculations
     - `tags` - Used for project categorization and filtering throughout the UI
     - `metadata` - Used for flexible additional project data storage
     - `stage_entered_at` - Used for tracking when projects entered their current stage
     - `project_type` - Used for project categorization (system_build, fabrication, manufacturing)
     - `notes` - Used for project-specific notes and comments
   - **Migrations created and applied**:
     - `20250127000007_add_missing_project_fields.sql` - Added estimated_value, tags, metadata fields

## Project Workflow System Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive workflow system to control and manage project status changes across all views (Flow, Kanban, and Table). Here's what was accomplished:

### Key Components Created:

1. **Workflow Validator** ([src/lib/workflow-validator.ts](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/src/lib/workflow-validator.ts)):
   - Enforces exit criteria validation for each stage
   - Prevents invalid backward movement in the workflow
   - Defines validation rules for stage progression

2. **Workflow Flowchart Component** ([src/components/project/WorkflowFlowchart.tsx](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/src/components/project/WorkflowFlowchart.tsx)):
   - Visual representation of the workflow stages
   - Project selection and detailed workflow management
   - Direct stage progression with validation

3. **Comprehensive Documentation** ([docs/workflow-system.md](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/docs/workflow-system.md)):
   - Detailed documentation of the workflow system
   - Explanation of all components and implementation details

### Key Enhancements Made:

1. **Enhanced useProjects Hook**:
   - Integrated workflow validation before any status updates
   - Added validation for both regular and optimistic updates
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback

2. **Updated WorkflowKanban Component**:
   - Added validation for drag-and-drop operations
   - Prevents invalid stage changes during drag operations

3. **Enhanced ProjectTable Component**:
   - Integrated workflow validation for dropdown status changes
   - Improved user feedback for validation results

4. **Updated Projects Page**:
   - Integrated the new WorkflowFlowchart component
   - Added project selection functionality for detailed workflow management

### Workflow Stages Implemented:

1. Inquiry Received
2. Technical Review
3. Supplier RFQ Sent
4. Quoted
5. Order Confirmed
6. Procurement & Planning
7. In Production
8. Shipped & Closed

Each stage now has specific exit criteria that must be met before a project can progress to the next stage. The system prevents invalid movements and provides clear feedback to users when validation fails.

### Validation Features:

- **Stage Progression Rules**: Projects cannot move backward in the workflow (except for specific allowed cases)
- **Exit Criteria Validation**: Each stage has defined criteria that must be met before progression
- **Real-time Validation**: Validation occurs immediately when a user attempts to change a project's status
- **User Feedback**: Clear error and warning messages via toast notifications
- **Error Prevention**: Invalid status changes are prevented with descriptive error messages

The workflow system is now fully integrated across all project views (Flow, Kanban, and Table), ensuring consistent validation and a better user experience when managing project lifecycles.
