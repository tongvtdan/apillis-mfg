## Architecture Notes

### Type System Evolution
The project has completed transition from a legacy enum-based stage system to a dynamic database-driven workflow system:

- **Legacy System**: `ProjectStage` enum with hardcoded stages (maintained for backward compatibility)
- **Current System**: `WorkflowStage` interface aligned with database schema
- **Database-Driven**: Workflow stages are now configurable via `workflow_stages` table
- **Status vs Stage**: `ProjectStatus` refers to project lifecycle (active/completed), while stages refer to workflow position
- **Schema Alignment**: Interface fields now match database columns exactly (`slug`, `stage_order`, `color`, etc.)
- **Computed Fields**: Legacy fields like `order_index` are computed from database fields for compatibility

### Component Architecture
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with `ProjectErrorBoundary`
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, then syncs with database
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions for live data
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching system for performance optimization
- **Table Views**: Simplified HTML tables for better performance and maintainability
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Automatic field mapping for backward compatibility with existing components
- **Dynamic Workflow Stages**: Components now use database-driven workflow stages via `workflowStageService`
- **Service Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes for better separation of concerns

## Development Guidelines

### Type Safety
- Always import the correct types for the context
- Use `ProjectStatus` for project lifecycle status ('active', 'completed', etc.)
- Use `ProjectStage` for legacy workflow stages (backward compatibility only)
- Use `WorkflowStage` for current database-driven workflow stages
- Use string IDs for workflow stage references (not enum values)
- Ensure interface fields match database schema exactly for new features
- Use computed fields (`order_index`) for legacy compatibility when needed
- Prefer `workflowStageService` methods over direct database queries for stage operations

### Error Handling
- Wrap components in appropriate error boundaries
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Provide fallback mechanisms for offline/error states

### Performance
- Leverage caching for frequently accessed data
- Use selective subscriptions for real-time updates
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- Prefer simple HTML tables over complex components for basic data display

### Data Compatibility
- Use automatic field mapping in data hooks for legacy component support
- Map database field names to expected component field names during data transformation
- Maintain both new database-aligned fields and legacy compatibility fields
- Ensure computed fields (like `order_index`) are available for existing sorting logic
