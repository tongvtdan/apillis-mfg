- What we completed / changed:
1. **ProjectTable Component Optimization**: Cleaned up unused state variables, removed unused imports, extracted utility functions, and improved code organization for better maintainability
2. **Fixed Duplicate Workflow Visualization Issue**: Removed duplicate "Workflow Visualization" and "Kanban-style project list" sections from WorkflowFlowchart component that were causing UI duplication

  9. **Cleaned up unused state variables**: Removed `isUpdating` state from Projects.tsx and `showUpdateAnimation`/`updateMessage` states from AppHeader.tsx
  10. **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up React hooks (useState, useEffect) that were no longer needed after animation removal

## Project Workflow System Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive workflow system to control and manage project status changes across all views (Flow, Kanban, and Table). Here's what was accomplished:

### Key Components Created:

1. **Workflow Validator** ([src/lib/workflow-validator.ts](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/src/lib/workflow-validator.ts)):
   - Enforces exit criteria validation for each stage
   - Prevents invalid backward movement in the workflow
   - Defines validation rules for stage progression

2. **Workflow Flowchart Component** ([src/components/project/WorkflowFlowchart.tsx](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/src/components/project/WorkflowFlowchart.tsx)):
   - Visual representation of the workflow stages
   - Project selection and detailed workflow management
   - Direct stage progression with validation

3. **Comprehensive Documentation** ([docs/workflow-system.md](file:///Volumes/Work/Projects/Apillis/Apillis-MFG/source/docs/workflow-system.md)):
   - Detailed documentation of the workflow system
   - Explanation of all components and implementation details

### Key Enhancements Made:

1. **Enhanced useProjects Hook**:
   - Integrated workflow validation before any status updates
   - Added validation for both regular and optimistic updates
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback

2. **Updated WorkflowKanban Component**:
   - Added validation for drag-and-drop operations
   - Prevents invalid stage changes during drag operations

3. **Enhanced ProjectTable Component**:
   - Integrated workflow validation for dropdown status changes
   - Improved user feedback for validation results

4. **Updated Projects Page**:
   - Integrated the new WorkflowFlowchart component
   - Added project selection functionality for detailed workflow management

### Workflow Stages Implemented:

1. Inquiry Received
2. Technical Review
3. Supplier RFQ Sent
4. Quoted
5. Order Confirmed
6. Procurement & Planning
7. In Production
8. Shipped & Closed

Each stage now has specific exit criteria that must be met before a project can progress to the next stage. The system prevents invalid movements and provides clear feedback to users when validation fails.

### Validation Features:

- **Stage Progression Rules**: Projects cannot move backward in the workflow (except for specific allowed cases)
- **Exit Criteria Validation**: Each stage has defined criteria that must be met before progression
- **Real-time Validation**: Validation occurs immediately when a user attempts to change a project's status
- **User Feedback**: Clear error and warning messages via toast notifications
- **Error Prevention**: Invalid status changes are prevented with descriptive error messages

The workflow system is now fully integrated across all project views (Flow, Kanban, and Table), ensuring consistent validation and a better user experience when managing project lifecycles.

### 2025-01-25
- **Database Performance Optimization Complete**: 
  1. Added comprehensive database indexes for faster queries (projects, RFQs, suppliers, customers)
  2. Created optimized `get_dashboard_summary()` RPC function to reduce server-side processing
  3. Implemented React Query with QueryClient for client-side caching and deduplication
  4. Created `useDashboardData` hook for efficient data fetching with 30s stale time
  5. Updated dashboard components to use optimized hooks instead of over-fetching
  6. Scoped real-time subscriptions to specific routes only (performance improvement)
  7. Reduced data payload by fetching only required fields in dashboard summary
  8. Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues with simplified dashboard data structure
  9. App launch performance significantly improved through optimized data fetching strategy

### 2025-01-22
- **Refresh Button and Notification Cleanup Complete**:
  1. Removed all "Refresh Projects" buttons from all project views (WorkflowFlowchart, ProjectTable, ProjectTypeKanban, PriorityKanban)
  2. Removed unused `showUpdateNotificationWithTimeout` function from update-notification.ts
  3. Cleaned up unused imports (RefreshCw, useProjects, useState) from components where refresh buttons were removed
  4. Removed unused state variables and functions related to refresh functionality
  5. Simplified component logic by removing manual refresh capabilities, relying on automatic real-time updates
  6. Streamlined user experience by removing redundant manual refresh options
