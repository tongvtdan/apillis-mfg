# Routing Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed ✅

The "Go to Dashboard" button in the Access Denied dialog was leading to a 404 page because:

1. **Root Cause**: The `ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES` in `src/lib/auth-constants.ts` was pointing management and admin roles to `/admin/dashboard`, but this route doesn't exist in `src/App.tsx`.

2. **Routes that existed**: Only `/dashboard` was defined in the routing configuration.

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Fixed Default Routes
**File**: `src/lib/auth-constants.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
export const ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES = {
    sales: '/dashboard',
    procurement: '/dashboard',
    engineering: '/dashboard',
    qa: '/dashboard',
    production: '/dashboard',
    management: '/admin/dashboard',  // ❌ This route doesn't exist
    admin: '/admin/dashboard',       // ❌ This route doesn't exist
} as const;
```

**After**:
```typescript
export const ROLE_DEFAULT_ROUTES = {
    sales: '/dashboard',
    procurement: '/dashboard',
    engineering: '/dashboard',
    qa: '/dashboard',
    production: '/dashboard',
    management: '/dashboard',        // ✅ Fixed to existing route
    admin: '/dashboard',             // ✅ Fixed to existing route
} as const;
```

### 2. Improved Navigation Method
**File**: `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Used window.location.href which can cause issues
onClick={() => window.location.href = getDefaultRoute()}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Added useNavigate hook and used React Router navigation
import { Navigate, useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();

// Updated all three access denied scenarios to use navigate()
onClick={() => navigate(getDefaultRoute())}
```

## Verification ✅

### Routes Available in App.tsx:
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (exists)
- ❌ `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard (does not exist)

### Default Routes Now:
- ✅ All roles → `/dashboard`
- ✅ No more references to non-existent `/admin/dashboard`

## Testing Steps ✅

1. **Access Denied Scenario 1**: Route-based access denial
   - User tries to access a route they don't have permission for
   - "Go to Dashboard" button should navigate to `/dashboard`

2. **Access Denied Scenario 2**: Role-based access denial (legacy)
   - User's role doesn't match required roles
   - "Go to Dashboard" button should navigate to `/dashboard`

3. **Access Denied Scenario 3**: Permission-based access denial
   - User doesn't have required permissions
   - "Go to Dashboard" button should navigate to `/dashboard`

## Result ✅

- ✅ "Go Back" button works correctly (uses `window.history.back()`)
- ✅ "Go to Dashboard" button now navigates to `/dashboard` for all users
- ✅ No more 404 errors when clicking "Go to Dashboard"
- ✅ Uses proper React Router navigation instead of window.location.href
- ✅ All user roles (sales, procurement, engineering, qa, production, management, admin) get the same dashboard route

## Build Status ✅

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No build errors
- ✅ All imports and navigation hooks properly configured
