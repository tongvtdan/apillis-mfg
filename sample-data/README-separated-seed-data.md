## üîó Referential Integrity

All seed data maintains proper foreign key relationships:

- **Organizations**: Base entities that all other data references
- **Workflow Stages**: Referenced by projects for current stage
- **Users**: Referenced by projects, reviews, messages, and notifications
- **Contacts**: Referenced by projects as customers
- **Projects**: Central entity referenced by documents, reviews, messages, and notifications
- **Documents**: Referenced by projects and uploaded by users
- **Reviews**: Referenced by projects and assigned to users
- **Messages**: Referenced by projects and sent by users
- **Notifications**: Referenced by users and projects
- **Activity Log**: References all major entities for audit trail

## üöÄ Import Order

When importing the seed data, follow this order to maintain referential integrity:

1. **Organizations** (01-organizations.json)
2. **Workflow Stages** (02-workflow-stages.json)
3. **Users** (03-users.json)
4. **Contacts** (04-contacts.json)
5. **Projects** (05-projects.json)
6. **Documents** (06-documents.json)
7. **Reviews** (07-reviews.json)
8. **Messages** (08-messages.json)
9. **Notifications** (09-notifications.json)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### For Development
```bash
# Seed projects using the provided script
npm run seed:projects

# Or with relationship fixing if needed
npm run seed:projects:fix

# Or force overwrite existing data
npm run seed:projects:force
```

### For Testing
```bash
# Use individual files for specific table testing
# Each file can be imported independently after dependencies are satisfied
```

### For Production
```bash
# Import in sequence ensuring all dependencies are met
# Verify referential integrity after each import
```

## üîç Data Validation

Each seed data file includes:
- **Unique UUIDs**: All entities have unique identifiers
- **Proper References**: All foreign keys reference existing entities
- **Realistic Data**: Vietnamese context with realistic company names and addresses
- **Complete Records**: All required fields are populated
- **Consistent Timestamps**: All records use consistent date/time format

## üìù Notes

- **Local Development**: All data is configured for local Supabase development
- **Vietnamese Context**: Addresses, names, and companies reflect Vietnamese manufacturing industry
- **Multi-tenant Ready**: Structure supports multiple organizations with proper isolation
- **AI Integration**: Includes AI processing fields for future automation features
- **Audit Trail**: Complete activity logging for compliance and debugging

## üö® Important

- **Never Reset Production**: These seed files are for development and testing only
- **Backup First**: Always backup existing data before importing
- **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all referenced entities exist before importing dependent data
- **Test Import Order**: Verify the import order works in your specific environment

## üìû Support

For questions about the seed data structure or import process, refer to:
- Database schema documentation
- Supabase CLI documentation
- Project architecture documentation


Database backups created:

factory_pulse_backup_20250831_085425.sql - Full schema backup (most recent)
factory_pulse_data_backup_20250831_085438.sql - Data-only backup
The full schema backup includes both the database structure and data, while the data-only backup contains just the data (with some warnings about circular foreign key constraints, which is normal for complex schemas).

To restore from backup later:



# Restore full backup (schema + data)
supabase db reset --local
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres < backups/factory_pulse_backup_20250831_085425.sql

# Or restore just data to existing schema
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres < backups/factory_pulse_data_backup_20250831_085438.sql
