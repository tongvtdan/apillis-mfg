## New Components Created

### Hooks
1. **`useSessionManager`** - Comprehensive session monitoring, automatic token refresh, and activity tracking
2. **`useRoleBasedNavigation`** - Dynamic navigation based on user roles
3. **`useAuditLogger`** - Comprehensive audit event logging

### Components
1. **`RoleAssignmentModal`** - User role management interface
2. **`SessionStatus`** - Real-time session status display
3. **Enhanced `ProtectedRoute`** - Advanced permission checking

### Enhancements
1. **`AuthContext`** - Added audit logging integration
2. **`AppHeader`** - Integrated session status component
3. **`App.tsx`** - Added session manager wrapper

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Session Management
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Proactive token refresh every 55 minutes with error handling

- **Session Expiration**: Graceful handling of expired sessions with automatic sign-out
- **Activity Detection**: Multi-event activity tracking (mouse, keyboard, touch, scroll)
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic session cleanup and user notification on refresh failures
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient event listeners and proper timer cleanup
- **Visual Indicators**: Session status display in header

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navigation items filtered by user permissions

- **Permission Checking**: Granular permission validation
- **Role Hierarchy**: Proper role hierarchy implementation
- **Access Denied Pages**: User-friendly error pages with guidance

### 3. User Profile Management
- **Role Assignment**: Admin interface for changing user roles
- **Profile Updates**: Enhanced profile management capabilities
- **Department Management**: Department assignment and tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for profile changes

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **Authentication Events**: Login/logout tracking
- **Permission Events**: Access denied and unauthorized access logging
- **Profile Changes**: Role and profile update tracking
- **Session Events**: Session expiration and token refresh logging
- **Detailed Context**: Rich event context with user agent, timestamps, etc.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Session Security
- Automatic session invalidation on expiration
- Proactive token refresh to prevent interruptions
- Activity-based session management
- Secure session status monitoring

### 2. Access Control
- Multi-level permission checking (route, resource, action)
- Role-based navigation filtering
- Comprehensive audit logging for security events
- Graceful handling of permission violations

### 3. User Management
- Secure role assignment with audit trails
- Profile update validation and logging
- Department-based access control support
- Administrative oversight for user management

## Integration Points

### 1. Existing Systems
- **Supabase Auth**: Enhanced existing integration
- **Database**: Leveraged existing user and audit tables
- **UI Components**: Used existing shadcn/ui components
- **Routing**: Enhanced existing React Router setup

### 2. New Integrations
- **Real-time Updates**: Session status updates
- **Activity Monitoring**: User activity tracking
- **Audit System**: Enhanced audit logging
- **Permission System**: Comprehensive permission checking

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Manual Verification
- ✅ All required files created and properly exported
- ✅ Components properly integrated into existing system
- ✅ Hooks properly implemented and functional
- ✅ Enhanced components include new functionality

### 2. Feature Verification
- ✅ Session management working with token refresh
- ✅ Role-based navigation filtering correctly
- ✅ Audit logging capturing all required events
- ✅ Protected routes enforcing permissions properly

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Session Management
The session manager automatically initializes when the app starts. Users can view their session status by clicking the shield icon in the header.

### 2. Role Assignment
Administrators can assign roles through the user management interface using the `RoleAssignmentModal` component.

### 3. Navigation
Navigation items are automatically filtered based on user permissions. Users only see menu items they have access to.

### 4. Audit Logging
All authentication and authorization events are automatically logged to the `activity_log` table with detailed context.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication
The system is ready for MFA integration with the existing session management.

### 2. Advanced Permissions
The permission system can be extended with more granular resource-level permissions.

### 3. Session Analytics
Session data can be used for user behavior analytics and security monitoring.

### 4. Real-time Notifications
The audit system can be extended to provide real-time security notifications.

## Conclusion

The authentication system has been successfully enhanced to meet all requirements of Task 1. The implementation provides:

- ✅ Complete Supabase Auth integration with role-based access control
- ✅ Comprehensive user profile management with role assignment
- ✅ Advanced protected route system with role-based navigation  
- ✅ Robust session management with automatic token refresh
- ✅ Detailed audit logging for all authentication events

The system is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for the remaining MVP tasks.
