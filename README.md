## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Local Supabase instance (for development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd factory-pulse

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp env.local.example env.local
# Edit env.local with your Supabase configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Database Setup

The project uses a local Supabase instance for development:

```bash
# Start local Supabase
supabase start

# Apply database schema (if migrations exist)
supabase db reset

# Seed sample data
npm run seed:organizations
npm run seed:contacts
npm run seed:workflow-stages
npm run seed:projects
```

## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (port 8080)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run build:dev    # Development build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

### Database Management
```bash
npm run seed:organizations     # Seed organization data
npm run seed:contacts         # Seed contact data
npm run seed:workflow-stages  # Seed workflow stages
npm run seed:projects         # Seed project data
npm run seed:approvals        # Seed approval data
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run all tests once
npm run test:ui       # Launch interactive test UI
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage reports
```

## Service Architecture

The application uses a layered service architecture for clean separation of concerns:

### Business Logic Layer
- **ProjectActionServiceSimplified** - High-level project operations with authentication
- **Comprehensive Operations** - Create, update, duplicate, archive, bulk operations
- **Automatic Context** - User authentication and organization resolution
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error management and logging

### Data Access Layer
- **ProjectServiceSimplified** - Core CRUD operations for projects
- **ProjectContactService** - Specialized contact management with arrays
- **Optimized Queries** - Efficient database operations with proper indexing

### Key Benefits
- **Simplified Contact Model** - Array-based storage instead of junction tables
- **Organization-based Customers** - Stable relationships via customer organizations
- **Performance Optimized** - Direct array operations and reduced JOINs
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript integration across all layers
