fix(workflow): Resolve stage transition RLS policy error

Triaging [bug]: Provide reproduction, likely cause, fix patch, and regression tests. Add a guard (type or runtime) to prevent recurrence.

Root Cause:
- Missing INSERT policy on activity_log table causing 403 Forbidden errors
- RLS was enabled but only SELECT policy existed
- Workflow transitions failed when trying to record activity

Fix:
- Added INSERT policy for activity_log table in new migration
- Improved error handling in frontend to be resilient to non-critical failures
- Modified StageHistoryService to warn but continue on logging failures
- Updated StageTransitionValidator and useStageTransition hook for better error handling

Prevention:
- Added validation script to check for proper RLS policies
- Created comprehensive tests for error scenarios
- Added documentation explaining the issue and fix

The workflow transitions now work reliably, and the system is more resilient to non-critical database errors.
