fix: optimize real-time subscription management to prevent duplicate subscriptions and excessive re-renders

- Optimized useEffect dependencies in useProjects hook to use specific object properties (user?.id, profile?.organization_id) instead of entire objects to prevent unnecessary re-runs
- Improved subscription deduplication in realtime manager to prevent multiple subscriptions from the same callback
- Enhanced rate limiting: increased debounce delay from 100ms to 300ms and rate limiting from 1s to 2s for better stability
- Added proper cleanup and error handling for subscription management
- Reduced console noise while maintaining debugging capability
- Fixed excessive re-renders that were causing multiple database calls and UI flickering

This addresses the issue where pressing "Test Direct Update" was causing multiple duplicate subscriptions and excessive re-renders, leading to performance issues and potential memory leaks.

Files changed:
- src/hooks/useProjects.ts: Optimized useEffect dependencies and subscription management
- src/lib/realtime-manager.ts: Improved subscription deduplication and rate limiting
- scripts/test-stage-transition-fix.md: Updated test guide with new improvements

Testing:
- Verify stage transitions update UI immediately without page refresh
- Check console for reduced duplicate subscription messages
- Confirm proper rate limiting prevents excessive API calls
- Test navigation between project detail pages for clean subscription management
