- **Added comprehensive debugging** to `userService.getUserById` for user lookup process
- **Optimized reviewer name display** to use pre-fetched data instead of separate DB calls

### 📁 **Files Modified**

#### `src/components/project/workflow/ReviewList.tsx`
- Updated `ReviewerDisplay` component to accept and use pre-fetched reviewer data
- Added fallback mechanism for missing reviewer data
- Removed unused `ReviewerName` component
- Updated component usage to pass reviewer data

### 🎯 **Issues Resolved**
- **Owner field**: Now shows actual user names instead of "Unknown User"
- **Reviewer field**: Now shows actual user names instead of "Unknown User"
- **Performance**: Reduced database calls by using pre-fetched reviewer data
- **Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to identify user lookup issues

### 📊 **Performance Improvements**
- **Before**: 1 + N database calls for reviewer names (1 for reviews + N for each reviewer)
- **After**: 1 database call (uses pre-fetched reviewer data from join)
- **Eliminated**: Duplicate user lookups for data already available

### 🧪 **Testing**
- No linting errors detected
- Component properly uses pre-fetched data
- Fallback mechanism in place
- Ready for testing user name display
