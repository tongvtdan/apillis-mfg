feat(activity-log): Add project_id column for enhanced analytics

This commit enhances the activity logging system by adding a dedicated project_id column to the activity_log table. This improvement enables more efficient project-based analytics and reporting.

Key changes:
- Added project_id column with foreign key constraint to projects table
- Updated log_activity function to automatically populate project_id
- Enhanced TypeScript types to include project_id
- Updated application code to utilize the new column
- Created new analytics service for project activity reporting
- Added visualization component for activity analytics

Benefits:
- Improved query performance for project-based analytics
- Enhanced data integrity with direct foreign key relationship
- Automatic population of project_id for relevant activities
- Backward compatibility with existing metadata approaches
- Better support for large-scale activity analysis

The changes are backward compatible and existing data/code continues to work. New activities will automatically populate the project_id column when applicable.
